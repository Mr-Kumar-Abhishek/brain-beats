It usually does not cause any problems, but sometimes it can invade other tissues and organs, causing serious infections. These infections are called actinomycosis, and they can affect the lungs, abdomen, pelvis, bones, joints, skin, and brain. Actinomycosis can cause abscesses, fistulas, inflammation, and tissue damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the alternative therapies that some people use for actinomycosis is Rife 3D frequencies. Rife 3D frequencies are based on the idea that every living organism has a specific frequency or vibration, and that applying the right frequency can destroy or weaken the organism. Rife 3D frequencies are generated by a device that emits electromagnetic waves through electrodes or plasma tubes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, I will show you how to use Rife 3D frequencies for actinomyces israelii. I will explain what frequencies to use, how long to use them, and what precautions to take. Please note that this is not a substitute for medical treatment, and that you should always consult your doctor before trying any alternative therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-frequencies-to-use&quot;&gt;What Frequencies to Use&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many different frequencies that are claimed to be effective for actinomyces israelii. However, there is no scientific evidence to support these claims, and the results may vary from person to person. Therefore, you should use caution and experiment with different frequencies to find what works best for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the sources that provides a list of frequencies for actinomyces israelii is the Rife 3D software. This software allows you to create your own presets of frequencies and run them on your device. According to the Rife 3D software, the frequencies for actinomyces israelii are: 23 hz, 222 hz, 262 hz, 2154 hz, 465 hz, 488 hz, 567 hz, 7880 hz, 10000 hz, 787 hz, 747 hz, 727 hz, 20 hz, 660 hz, 690 hz, 160 hz, 73 hz, 1.1 hz&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These frequencies are based on the work of Dr. Royal Raymond Rife, who was a pioneer in the field of frequency therapy in the early 20th century. He claimed to have discovered the frequencies that could kill various pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. However, his work was controversial and never accepted by the mainstream medical community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-long-to-use-them&quot;&gt;How Long to Use Them&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The duration of using Rife 3D frequencies depends on several factors, such as the severity of your infection, your overall health, your device settings, and your personal preference. There is no definitive answer to how long you should use them, but here are some general guidelines:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start with a low intensity and a short session. For example, you can start with a 10-minute session at a low power level.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gradually increase the intensity and the duration as you feel comfortable. For example, you can increase the session length by 5 minutes every week until you reach an hour.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Listen to your body and adjust accordingly. If you feel any discomfort or adverse effects, such as headache, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, or skin irritation, stop the session immediately and reduce the intensity or duration next time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not overdo it. Using Rife 3D frequencies too much or too often can cause more harm than good. It can overload your system and cause stress or damage to your cells and organs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take breaks between sessions. Give your body time to rest and recover from the frequency exposure. You can take a day or two off every week or every month.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Monitor your symptoms and results. Keep track of how you feel before and after each session. Note any changes in your infection signs, such as pain, swelling, drainage, fever, or weight loss.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consult your doctor regularly. Do not rely solely on Rife 3D frequencies for treating your infection. Follow your doctor’s advice and take any prescribed medications as directed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-precautions-to-take&quot;&gt;What Precautions to Take&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Rife 3D frequencies is not without risks or side effects. You should be aware of the potential dangers and take precautions to avoid them. Here are some of the precautions you should take:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not use Rife 3D frequencies if you have a pacemaker, defibrillator, or any other implanted electronic device. The sound waves can interfere with the device and cause malfunction or damage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not use Rife 3D frequencies if you are pregnant, nursing, or trying to conceive. The sound waves can affect the development of the fetus or the quality of the breast milk.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not use Rife 3D frequencies if you have epilepsy, seizures, or any other neurological disorder. The sound waves can trigger or worsen the condition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rife 3D frequencies are a form of alternative therapy that some people use for actinomyces israelii infections. They are based on the idea that applying specific frequencies can kill or weaken the bacteria. However, there is no scientific evidence to support this claim, and the results may vary from person to person. Therefore, you should use caution and discretion when using Rife 3D frequencies. You should also consult your doctor before and during the treatment, and follow their instructions. Rife 3D frequencies are not a cure or a substitute for medical care.&lt;/p&gt;

Some of the most common species of Actinobacillus are A. actinomycetemcomitans, A. pleuropneumoniae, A. suis, and A. equuli. These bacteria can be difficult to treat with conventional antibiotics, and may lead to chronic or fatal conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there is an alternative way to deal with Actinobacillus infections: Rife 3D frequencies. Rife 3D frequencies are sound waves that are designed to target and destroy specific pathogens by resonating with their molecular structure. Rife 3D frequencies are based on the work of Dr. Royal Raymond Rife, who discovered that every microorganism has a unique frequency that can be used to eliminate it without harming the surrounding tissue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rife 3D frequencies are different from the original Rife frequencies in that they use three-dimensional sound waves that can penetrate deeper into the body and reach the hidden locations of the bacteria. Rife 3D frequencies also use a higher range of frequencies that can cover more pathogens and enhance the healing effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, I will show you how to use Rife 3D frequencies for Actinobacillus infections. I will also share with you a preset that I have created for mental relief from Actinobacillus, which can help you cope with the stress and anxiety caused by the infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-use-rife-3d-frequencies-for-actinobacillus&quot;&gt;How to Use Rife 3D Frequencies for Actinobacillus&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use Rife 3D frequencies for Actinobacillus, you will need a device that can generate and play these frequencies, such as a Rife machine, a frequency generator, or a smartphone app. You will also need a pair of headphones or speakers that can produce high-quality sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The procedure is simple: you just need to select the frequency or preset that matches the Actinobacillus species that you want to target, and play it for the recommended duration and intensity. You can do this once or twice a day, depending on your condition and preference. You should also drink plenty of water before and after the session to help flush out the toxins released by the dying bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of Rife 3D frequencies for different Actinobacillus species:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A. actinomycetemcomitans: 488 hz, 565 hz, 672 hz, 674 hz, 678 hz&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A. pleuropneumoniae: 773 hz, 766 hz, 768 hz&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A. suis: 776 hz, 777 hz&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A. equuli: 778 hz, 822 hz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also combine these frequencies to create your own custom preset for Actinobacillus.&lt;/p&gt;

However, aconite can also be toxic and cause serious side effects if taken in large doses or for a long time. Therefore, it is not recommended to use aconite without proper guidance from a qualified practitioner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One alternative way to benefit from the healing properties of aconite without ingesting it is to use Rife 3D frequencies. Rife 3D frequencies are sound waves that are designed to resonate with specific organs, tissues, or pathogens in the body. By applying these frequencies to the affected area, you can stimulate the natural healing process and restore balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, I will share with you a Rife 3D frequencies preset that I have created for mental relief from aconite. This preset is based on the research of Dr. Royal Raymond Rife, who discovered that certain frequencies can destroy harmful microorganisms and enhance the immune system. The frequencies in this preset are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3347 hz: This frequency is associated with the thymus gland, which is responsible for producing T-cells that fight infections and cancer. This frequency can help boost your immunity and protect you from diseases.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5611 hz: This frequency is associated with the hypothalamus, which is the master gland that regulates many functions in the body, such as mood, appetite, sleep, and stress. This frequency can help balance your hormones and emotions and reduce anxiety and depression.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2791 hz: This frequency is associated with the pineal gland, which is the seat of intuition and spirituality. This frequency can help activate your third eye and enhance your psychic abilities and awareness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use this preset, you will need &lt;a href=&quot;https://brain-beats.in&quot;&gt;brain beats&lt;/a&gt; that can generate these frequencies and apply them to your body. You can either use headphones or speakers to listen to the frequencies. You should use this preset for at least 15 minutes a day, preferably before bedtime, to achieve optimal results.&lt;/p&gt;

It can cause inflammation, redness, pimples, and scars on the face and other parts of the body. Acne can also affect one’s self-esteem and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many treatments available for acne, such as creams, antibiotics, hormones, and lasers. However, some of these treatments may have side effects, be expensive, or not work for everyone. That’s why some people look for alternative or complementary therapies, such as Rife 3D frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rife 3D frequencies are a type of sound therapy that uses specific frequencies to target different health conditions. They are based on the work of Dr. Royal Raymond Rife, who claimed that he could cure diseases by destroying their microorganisms with resonant frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rife 3D frequencies are not proven by scientific evidence and may not be safe or effective for everyone. They should not replace any medical advice or treatment from your doctor. If you have any health concerns or questions, please consult your doctor before using Rife 3D frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use Rife 3D frequencies for acne relief, you will need a device that can generate and play the frequencies, such as a computer, a smartphone, or a speaker. You will also need a preset that contains the frequencies for acne. A preset is a file that has a list of frequencies and their durations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example of a preset for acne is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acne Rife 3D frequencies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is Rife 3D frequencies preset for mental relief from Acne (run 564 for 6 min). The frequencies in this preset are: 2720 hz, 2170 hz, 1800 hz, 1600 hz, 1550 hz, 1552 hz, 1500 hz, 802 hz, 880 hz, 778 hz, 787 hz, 760 hz, 741 hz, 727 hz, 660 hz, 564 hz, 465 hz, 450 hz, 444 hz, 428 hz&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use this preset, you will need to visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://brain-beats.in&quot;&gt;brain beats&lt;/a&gt; in your device. Then go the the rife 3D machine and search this preset there from the search box. You will also need to connect your device to a speaker or headphones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have everything ready, you can start playing the preset. You should listen to it at a comfortable volume level and in a quiet environment. You can close your eyes and relax while listening to the frequencies. You can also visualize your skin healing and clearing up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should run the preset for the duration specified in the description. You can repeat the preset as often as you like or as recommended by the creator. However, you should not overdo it or expect immediate results. Rife 3D frequencies are not a magic cure and may take time to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should also monitor your skin condition and any changes or reactions that may occur. If you notice any improvement or worsening of your acne or any other symptoms, you should stop using the preset and contact your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

One of the possible causes of acidosis is poor diet, especially consuming too much processed foods, sugar, alcohol, and caffeine. To restore the body’s pH balance, it is recommended to eat more alkaline foods, such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds, and to drink plenty of water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, diet alone may not be enough to combat acidosis and its effects on the mental state. That’s where Rife 3D frequencies come in. Rife 3D frequencies are sound waves that are designed to stimulate the body’s natural healing processes and to enhance the mood and well-being. They are based on the work of Dr. Royal Raymond Rife, who discovered that certain frequencies can destroy harmful microorganisms and restore health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, we will introduce you to a Rife 3D frequencies preset that is specifically tailored for mental relief from acidosis. This preset contains eight frequencies that target the root causes and symptoms of acidosis, such as inflammation, infection, pain, and depression. The frequencies are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;10000 hz: This frequency is known as the master frequency, as it can help with any condition and boost the immune system. It also has a calming effect on the mind and can reduce stress and anxiety.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;880 hz: This frequency can help with inflammation, which is one of the consequences of acidosis. It can also improve blood circulation and oxygen delivery to the cells.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;802 hz: This frequency can help with infection, which can also result from acidosis. It can kill bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites that may cause disease and imbalance in the body.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;787 hz: This frequency can help with pain relief, which is another symptom of acidosis. It can also stimulate the production of endorphins, which are natural painkillers and mood enhancers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;776 hz: This frequency can help with depression, which is often associated with acidosis. It can increase serotonin levels, which are neurotransmitters that regulate mood, sleep, appetite, and cognition.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;727 hz: This frequency can help with detoxification, which is essential for restoring pH balance in the body. It can also support liver function and eliminate toxins from the blood.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;146 hz: This frequency can help with digestion, which is important for maintaining alkalinity in the body. It can also aid in nutrient absorption and metabolism.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;20 hz: This frequency can help with relaxation, which is beneficial for mental health. It can also induce a state of meditation and awareness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use this preset, you will need a Rife 3D device that can generate these frequencies and deliver them to your body through speakers. You can find more information about Rife 3D devices and how to use them on our website. You should use this preset for at least 15 minutes a day, preferably before bedtime or in the morning. You should also consult your doctor before using this preset if you have any medical conditions or are taking any medications.&lt;/p&gt;

To restore the body’s pH balance, it is recommended to eat more alkaline foods, such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds, and to drink plenty of water.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How to Use Rife 3D Frequencies for Abscesses Secondary</title><link href="https://brain-beats.in/blog/blog/2023/03/24/how-to-use-rife-3d-frequencies-for-abscesses-secondary.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How to Use Rife 3D Frequencies for Abscesses Secondary" /><published>2023-03-24T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2023-03-24T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>https://brain-beats.in/blog/blog/2023/03/24/how-to-use-rife-3d-frequencies-for-abscesses-secondary</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://brain-beats.in/blog/blog/2023/03/24/how-to-use-rife-3d-frequencies-for-abscesses-secondary.html">&lt;p&gt;Abscesses secondary are a type of infection that occurs when bacteria or other microorganisms enter a wound or a damaged tissue and cause pus to accumulate. They can cause pain, swelling, redness, fever, and sometimes serious complications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the alternative treatments that some people use for abscesses secondary is Rife 3D frequencies. Rife 3D frequencies are based on the idea that different frequencies of sound can affect the cells and organs of the body, and that some frequencies can kill harmful pathogens or stimulate healing processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rife 3D frequencies are generated by a device called a Rife machine, which emits sound waves through electrodes attached to the skin or through speakers. The Rife machine can be programmed with different presets, which are combinations of frequencies that target specific conditions or symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, I will show you how to use Rife 3D frequencies preset for mental relief from abscesses secondary. This preset contains the following frequencies: 1550 hz, 802 hz, 760 hz, 660 hz, 465 hz, 450 hz, 444 hz, 428 hz. These frequencies are said to have anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antibacterial, antiviral, and immune-boosting effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-1-prepare-your-rife-machine-and-your-environment&quot;&gt;Step 1: Prepare your Rife machine and your environment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you start using Rife 3D frequencies, you need to make sure that your Rife machine is working properly and that you have a comfortable and quiet environment. You will need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A Brain Beats Rife machine that can generate Rife 3D frequencies. You can use it online or build your own from a the generator. Make sure that it has the preset for abscesses secondary or that you can program it manually with the frequencies listed above.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Speakers to deliver the sound waves to your body. If you use speakers, you will need to place them close to your ears or around your head.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A timer or a stopwatch to keep track of the duration of each session.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A comfortable chair or bed where you can relax and listen to the sound waves.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A dim light or a blindfold to block out any visual distractions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A glass of water to drink before and after each session.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-2-start-the-session-and-listen-to-the-sound-waves&quot;&gt;Step 2: Start the session and listen to the sound waves&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have everything ready, you can start the session and listen to the sound waves. You will need to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn on your Rife machine and select the preset for abscesses secondary or enter the frequencies manually.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adjust the volume of the sound waves to a level that is comfortable for you. You should be able to hear them clearly but not too loudly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set your timer or stopwatch for 15 minutes. This is the recommended duration for each session, but you can adjust it according to your preference and tolerance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sit or lie down in a comfortable position and close your eyes or put on your blindfold.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Relax your mind and body and focus on your breathing. Try not to think about anything else but the sound waves and how they make you feel.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you feel any discomfort, pain, nausea, dizziness, or other negative reactions during the session, stop immediately and consult your doctor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-3-end-the-session-and-drink-some-water&quot;&gt;Step 3: End the session and drink some water&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When your timer or stopwatch goes off, you can end the session and drink some water. You will need to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn off your Rife machine and remove the electrodes or speakers from your body or ears.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drink a glass of water to hydrate yourself and flush out any toxins that may have been released by the sound waves.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rest for a few minutes and observe how you feel. You may notice some changes in your mood, energy level, pain level, or infection status.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Repeat the session once or twice a day until you see improvement in your condition. You can also combine Rife 3D frequencies with other treatments such as antibiotics, herbal remedies, or homeopathy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Abscesses are pus-filled infections that can occur anywhere in the body, but are most common in the skin, gums, or teeth. They can cause swelling, inflammation, fever, and discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the ways to treat abscesses is to use Rife 3D frequencies. Rife 3D frequencies are sound waves that are designed to target and destroy harmful microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. Rife 3D frequencies are based on the work of Dr. Royal Raymond Rife, who discovered that every microorganism has a specific frequency that can be used to kill it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rife 3D frequencies are not only effective for physical healing, but also for mental relief. By using Rife 3D frequencies, you can reduce stress, anxiety, depression, and negative emotions that may be associated with abscesses. Rife 3D frequencies can also enhance your mood, energy, focus, and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, I will share with you a preset of Rife 3D frequencies that I have personally used for mental relief from abscesses 1. This preset contains 17 frequencies that range from 190 hz to 2720 hz. These frequencies are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2720 hz: This frequency is good for general detoxification and cleansing of the body. It can also help with skin problems, such as acne, eczema, and psoriasis.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2170 hz: This frequency is good for boosting the immune system and fighting infections. It can also help with allergies, asthma, and sinusitis.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1865 hz: This frequency is good for stimulating the lymphatic system and draining excess fluids from the body. It can also help with edema, cellulitis, and lymphadenitis.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1550 hz: This frequency is good for reducing inflammation and pain. It can also help with arthritis, rheumatism, and gout.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;444 hz: This frequency is good for harmonizing the chakras and aligning the energy centers. It can also help with spiritual awakening, intuition, and psychic abilities.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;428 hz: This frequency is good for connecting with nature and enhancing the creativity. It can also help with artistic expression, inspiration, and imagination.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;190 hz: This frequency is good for grounding the body and stabilizing the emotions. It can also help with fear, anger, and resentment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full set of frequencies are: 2720 hz, 2170 hz, 1865 hz, 1550 hz, 880 hz, 802 hz, 787 hz, 760 hz, 727 hz, 690 hz, 660 hz, 500 hz, 465 hz, 450 hz, 444 hz, 428 hz, 190 hz&lt;/p&gt;

They are usually caused by bacterial infections, such as Staphylococcus aureus or Listeria monocytogenes. If left untreated, abscesses can lead to serious complications, such as sepsis, tissue damage, or organ failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the alternative treatments that some people use for abscesses is Rife 3D frequencies. Rife 3D frequencies are based on the idea that different pathogens have different resonant frequencies, and that exposing them to those frequencies can destroy them. Rife 3D frequencies are generated by a device that emits sound waves through speakers or headphones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, we will explain how to use Rife 3D frequencies for abscesses, and what precautions you should take before trying this method. Please note that this is not a medical advice, and that you should always consult your doctor before using any alternative treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-use-rife-3d-frequencies-for-abscesses&quot;&gt;How to Use Rife 3D Frequencies for Abscesses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use Rife 3D frequencies for abscesses, you will need a Rife 3D device, a computer with the software installed, and a pair of speakers or headphones. You will also need a preset for abscesses, which is a list of frequencies that are supposed to target the bacteria causing the infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The preset for abscesses that we recommend is: 2720 hz, 2170 hz, 1865 hz, 1550 hz, 880 hz, 802 hz, 787 hz, 727 hz, 500 hz, 444 hz, 190 hz&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also use the preset for Staphylococcus aureus and Listeriose, which are two common bacteria that cause abscesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use the preset, follow these steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect your Speakers or headphones to your computer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Launch the brain beats software/website and select the preset for abscesses from the menu.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put on the speakers or headphones and adjust the volume to a comfortable level. Make sure that you can hear the sound clearly, but not too loud.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start the program and let it run for the duration of the preset, which is usually between 30 minutes to an hour.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Repeat the treatment once or twice a day until the mental relief from abscess.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;precautions-and-side-effects&quot;&gt;Precautions and Side Effects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rife 3D frequencies are generally considered safe and non-invasive, but they may have some side effects or risks. Some of them are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hearing loss or damage from prolonged exposure to loud sounds.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tinnitus, which is a ringing or buzzing in the ears.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Headache, nausea, dizziness, or vertigo from the sound waves.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Herxheimer reaction, which is a temporary worsening of symptoms due to the die-off of bacteria and toxins.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dehydration, fatigue, or electrolyte imbalance from the treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Possible damage to healthy cells or organs from prolonged exposure to high frequencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To minimize these risks, you should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use a low intensity setting on your device and adjust it according to your comfort level.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drink plenty of water before and after the treatment to flush out toxins and prevent dehydration.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take breaks between sessions and do not overuse the device.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Monitor your symptoms and stop the treatment if you experience any adverse reactions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Seek medical attention if your abscess does not improve or worsens after using Rife 3D frequencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rife 3D frequencies are a form of alternative therapy that some people use for abscesses and other infections. They are based on the principle of resonant frequency killing, which claims that exposing pathogens to their specific frequencies can destroy them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is no scientific evidence to support this claim, and Rife 3D frequencies are not approved by any health authority as a treatment for any disease. &lt;strong&gt;Therefore, you should not rely on them as a substitute for conventional medicine&lt;/strong&gt;, and you should always consult your doctor before trying them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you decide to use Rife 3D frequencies for abscesses, you should follow the instructions carefully and take precautions to avoid any side effects or complications. You should also monitor your condition closely and seek medical help if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;3000 hz: This frequency helps to reduce inflammation and swelling in your abdomen.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;95 hz: This frequency helps to relax your muscles and nerves and ease spasms and cramps.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 hz: This frequency helps to calm your mind and emotions and reduce stress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use this preset, simply play it for at least 15 minutes a day, preferably before going to bed or when you feel the pain. You can also repeat it as often as needed throughout the day. Make sure to listen to it at a comfortable volume level and avoid any distractions. You may also want to drink plenty of water before and after the session to help flush out any toxins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rife 3D frequencies are a safe and natural way to relieve your abdominal pain without any side effects or drugs. However, they are not intended to replace medical advice or treatment. If you have any serious or chronic health condition, please consult your doctor before using them.
