The brain interprets the difference between the two tones as a third tone, called a binaural beat, and synchronizes its brain waves to match the frequency of the beat. This can influence the brain’s state of consciousness and mood.</p> <p>One of the frequencies that can be used for binaural beats is 11 Hz, which falls in the alpha range of brain waves. Alpha waves are associated with a state of relaxed focus, where the mind is alert but not overstimulated. In this article, we will explore some of the benefits of listening to 11 Hz binaural beats and how they can help you achieve a “relaxed yet alert” state.</p> <h2 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-11-hz-binaural-beats">What are the benefits of 11 Hz binaural beats?</h2> <p>According to research and anecdotal evidence, listening to 11 Hz binaural beats can have various benefits, such as:</p> <ul> <li><strong>A gentle focused alertness</strong>: 11 Hz binaural beats can help you stay focused on a task without getting distracted or stressed.
