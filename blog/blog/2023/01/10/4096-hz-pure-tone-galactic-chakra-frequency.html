This is the ninth chakra in the 12-chakra system, and it is located about a foot above the crown chakra. It is associated with a pure tone of 4096 hz, which is said to activate and balance this energy center.</p> <p>The galactic chakra is also known as the channel of prophecy, because it allows us to transcend the limitations of space and time and access the Akashic Records. The Akashic Records are a cosmic database that contains the history and future of every soul and every event in the universe. By tapping into this source of wisdom, we can gain insight into our past lives, our soul purpose, our karmic lessons, and our potential future.</p> <p>However, opening the galactic chakra is not an easy task. It requires a high level of spiritual development and mastery of the lower chakras. It also involves facing the extremes of positive and negative polarity, as we encounter both the light and the shadow aspects of ourselves and the universe. Many people get stuck in this stage, as they become attached to their psychic abilities or their egoic agendas. They may also experience fear, confusion, or delusion as they encounter realities that challenge their beliefs and perceptions.</p> <p>To successfully activate and balance the galactic chakra, we need to cultivate a state of detachment, humility, and surrender. We need to trust our intuition and follow our inner guidance, without letting our ego interfere. We need to embrace both the light and the dark, without judgment or resistance. We need to be open to receive and share the messages that come from the Akashic Records, without distortion or manipulation.</p> <p>One way to help us achieve this is to listen to the 4096 hz pure tone frequency. This sound can help us align our vibration with the galactic chakra and enhance our connection with the Akashic Records. You can find many videos on YouTube that offer this frequency, or you can use a tone generator app to create your own. You can listen to this sound while meditating, relaxing, or sleeping, and pay attention to any visions, sensations, or insights that arise.</p> <p>The galactic chakra is a powerful portal to higher dimensions of consciousness. By activating and balancing this chakra, we can access the cosmic wisdom that can help us fulfill our soul mission and contribute to the evolution of humanity.</p> </div> </article> </main> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="text-center"> <ul> <li><a href="mailto:brainbeats@protonmail.com"><i title="email" class="fa-solid fa-envelope"></i></a></li> <li><a href="/blog/atom.xml"><i title="RSS" class="fa-solid fa-square-rss"></i></a></li> </ul> </footer> <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.1.min.js" integrity="sha256-o88AwQnZB+VDvE9tvIXrMQaPlFFSUTR+nldQm1LuPXQ=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.0/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-A3rJD856KowSb7dwlZdYEkO39Gagi7vIsF0jrRAoQmDKKtQBHUuLZ9AsSv4jD4Xa" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://brain-beats.in/blog/js/main.js"></script> </body> </html>
