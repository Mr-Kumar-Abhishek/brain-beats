It can be caused by infections, endometriosis, tumors, or other factors. Adnexitis can affect fertility and increase the risk of complications such as ectopic pregnancy or pelvic abscess.</p> <p>Rife 3D frequencies are a form of sound therapy that uses specific frequencies to target and destroy harmful microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites. Rife 3D frequencies are based on the work of Dr. Royal Raymond Rife, who discovered that each microorganism has a resonant frequency that can be used to destroy it.</p> <p>In this blog post, I will show you how to use Rife 3D frequencies for adnexitis, using a preset that I have created based on research and experience. This preset contains six frequencies that are designed to eliminate the common causes of adnexitis, such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, mycoplasma, streptococcus, staphylococcus, and candida.</p> <h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2> <p>This blog post is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice. Rife 3D frequencies are not approved by the FDA or any other regulatory agency and have not been proven to be effective or safe for any condition. You should consult your doctor before using Rife 3D frequencies or any other alternative therapy. You should also follow your doctor’s instructions regarding diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of adnexitis. I am not responsible for any harm or damage that may result from using Rife 3D frequencies or this preset.</p> <h2 id="how-to-use-the-preset">How to Use the Preset</h2> <p>To use this preset, you will need a device that can generate and play Rife 3D frequencies, such as a Spooky2 generator or a smartphone app or website such as <a href="https://brain-beats.in">brain beats</a>. You will also need a way to deliver the frequencies to your body, such as headphones, speakers, contact electrodes, plasma tube, or scalar field.</p> <p>The preset contains six frequencies that are played in sequence for three minutes each. The total duration of the preset is 18 minutes. You can repeat the preset as often as you like, depending on your condition and response. Some people may notice improvement after one session, while others may need several sessions over days or weeks.</p> <p>The frequencies in this preset are:</p> <ul> <li>440 hz: This frequency is used to balance the body and mind and to enhance the immune system.</li> <li>441 hz: This frequency is used to target chlamydia, which is a common cause of adnexitis and can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) if left untreated.</li> <li>522 hz: This frequency is used to target gonorrhea, which is another common cause of adnexitis and PID. Gonorrhea can also cause infertility and increase the risk of HIV transmission.</li> <li>572 hz: This frequency is used to target mycoplasma, which is a type of bacteria that can cause adnexitis and PID. Mycoplasma can also cause chronic pelvic pain and urinary tract infections.</li> <li>3343 hz: This frequency is used to target streptococcus, which is a group of bacteria that can cause adnexitis and PID. Streptococcus can also cause pharyngitis, tonsillitis, scarlet fever, rheumatic fever, and necrotizing fasciitis.</li> <li>3833 hz: This frequency is used to target staphylococcus, which is another group of bacteria that can cause adnexitis and PID. Staphylococcus can also cause skin infections, abscesses, boils, impetigo, cellulitis, and toxic shock syndrome.</li> <li>5312 hz: This frequency is used to target candida, which is a type of fungus that can cause adnexitis and PID. Candida can also cause vaginal yeast infections, oral thrush, diaper rash, and systemic candidiasis.</li> </ul> <p>To use the preset, follow these steps:</p> <ol> <li>Connect your device to your delivery method of choice (headphones, speakers, electrodes, etc.)</li> <li>Load the preset on your device or app</li> <li>Start the preset and relax</li> <li>Listen to the frequencies for 18 minutes</li> <li>Stop the preset and disconnect your device</li> <li>Drink plenty of water and rest</li> <li>Repeat as needed</li> </ol> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>Rife 3D frequencies are a potential alternative therapy for adnexitis that uses sound waves to kill harmful microorganisms. This blog post has shown you how to use a preset that I have created for adnexitis that contains six frequencies that target the common causes of this condition.</p> <p>However, remember that Rife 3D frequencies are not a substitute for medical care and that you should always consult your doctor before using them or any other alternative therapy. You should also follow your doctor’s advice regarding diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of adnexitis.</p> <p>I hope you found this blog post helpful and informative.
