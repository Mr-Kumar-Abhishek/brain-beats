A Guide for Mental Relief</h1> <time class="meta" datetime="2023-03-25 00:00:00 +0530">25 Mar 2023</time> <div class="post"> <p>Acidosis is a condition where the body’s pH level becomes too acidic, which can cause various health problems such as fatigue, inflammation, pain, and depression. One of the possible causes of acidosis is poor diet, especially consuming too much processed foods, sugar, alcohol, and caffeine. To restore the body’s pH balance, it is recommended to eat more alkaline foods, such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds, and to drink plenty of water.</p> <p>However, diet alone may not be enough to combat acidosis and its effects on the mental state. That’s where Rife 3D frequencies come in. Rife 3D frequencies are sound waves that are designed to stimulate the body’s natural healing processes and to enhance the mood and well-being. They are based on the work of Dr. Royal Raymond Rife, who discovered that certain frequencies can destroy harmful microorganisms and restore health.</p> <p>In this blog post, we will introduce you to a Rife 3D frequencies preset that is specifically tailored for mental relief from acidosis. This preset contains eight frequencies that target the root causes and symptoms of acidosis, such as inflammation, infection, pain, and depression. The frequencies are:</p> <ul> <li>10000 hz: This frequency is known as the master frequency, as it can help with any condition and boost the immune system. It also has a calming effect on the mind and can reduce stress and anxiety.</li> <li>880 hz: This frequency can help with inflammation, which is one of the consequences of acidosis. It can also improve blood circulation and oxygen delivery to the cells.</li> <li>802 hz: This frequency can help with infection, which can also result from acidosis. It can kill bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites that may cause disease and imbalance in the body.</li> <li>787 hz: This frequency can help with pain relief, which is another symptom of acidosis. It can also stimulate the production of endorphins, which are natural painkillers and mood enhancers.</li> <li>776 hz: This frequency can help with depression, which is often associated with acidosis. It can increase serotonin levels, which are neurotransmitters that regulate mood, sleep, appetite, and cognition.</li> <li>727 hz: This frequency can help with detoxification, which is essential for restoring pH balance in the body. It can also support liver function and eliminate toxins from the blood.</li> <li>146 hz: This frequency can help with digestion, which is important for maintaining alkalinity in the body. It can also aid in nutrient absorption and metabolism.</li> <li>20 hz: This frequency can help with relaxation, which is beneficial for mental health. It can also induce a state of meditation and awareness.</li> </ul> <p>To use this preset, you will need a Rife 3D device that can generate these frequencies and deliver them to your body through speakers. You can find more information about Rife 3D devices and how to use them on our website. You should use this preset for at least 15 minutes a day, preferably before bedtime or in the morning. You should also consult your doctor before using this preset if you have any medical conditions or are taking any medications.</p> <p>Disclaimer: <strong>This blog post is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.
