They are usually caused by bacterial infections, such as Staphylococcus aureus or Listeria monocytogenes. If left untreated, abscesses can lead to serious complications, such as sepsis, tissue damage, or organ failure.</p> <p>One of the alternative treatments that some people use for abscesses is Rife 3D frequencies. Rife 3D frequencies are based on the idea that different pathogens have different resonant frequencies, and that exposing them to those frequencies can destroy them. Rife 3D frequencies are generated by a device that emits sound waves through speakers or headphones.</p> <p>In this blog post, we will explain how to use Rife 3D frequencies for abscesses, and what precautions you should take before trying this method. Please note that this is not a medical advice, and that you should always consult your doctor before using any alternative treatments.</p> <h2 id="how-to-use-rife-3d-frequencies-for-abscesses">How to Use Rife 3D Frequencies for Abscesses</h2> <p>To use Rife 3D frequencies for abscesses, you will need a Rife 3D device, a computer with the software installed, and a pair of speakers or headphones. You will also need a preset for abscesses, which is a list of frequencies that are supposed to target the bacteria causing the infection.</p> <p>The preset for abscesses that we recommend is: 2720 hz, 2170 hz, 1865 hz, 1550 hz, 880 hz, 802 hz, 787 hz, 727 hz, 500 hz, 444 hz, 190 hz</p> <p>You can also use the preset for Staphylococcus aureus and Listeriose, which are two common bacteria that cause abscesses.</p> <p>To use the preset, follow these steps:</p> <ol> <li>Connect your Speakers or headphones to your computer.</li> <li>Launch the brain beats software/website and select the preset for abscesses from the menu.</li> <li>Put on the speakers or headphones and adjust the volume to a comfortable level. Make sure that you can hear the sound clearly, but not too loud.</li> <li>Start the program and let it run for the duration of the preset, which is usually between 30 minutes to an hour.</li> <li>Repeat the treatment once or twice a day until the mental relief from abscess.</li> </ol> <h2 id="precautions-and-side-effects">Precautions and Side Effects</h2> <p>Rife 3D frequencies are generally considered safe and non-invasive, but they may have some side effects or risks. Some of them are:</p> <ul> <li>Hearing loss or damage from prolonged exposure to loud sounds.</li> <li>Tinnitus, which is a ringing or buzzing in the ears.</li> <li>Headache, nausea, dizziness, or vertigo from the sound waves.</li> <li>Herxheimer reaction, which is a temporary worsening of symptoms due to the die-off of bacteria and toxins.</li> <li>Dehydration, fatigue, or electrolyte imbalance from the treatment.</li> <li>Possible damage to healthy cells or organs from prolonged exposure to high frequencies.</li> </ul> <p>To minimize these risks, you should:</p> <ul> <li>Use a low intensity setting on your device and adjust it according to your comfort level.</li> <li>Drink plenty of water before and after the treatment to flush out toxins and prevent dehydration.</li> <li>Take breaks between sessions and do not overuse the device.</li> <li>Monitor your symptoms and stop the treatment if you experience any adverse reactions.</li> <li>Seek medical attention if your abscess does not improve or worsens after using Rife 3D frequencies.</li> </ul> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>Rife 3D frequencies are a form of alternative therapy that some people use for abscesses and other infections. They are based on the principle of resonant frequency killing, which claims that exposing pathogens to their specific frequencies can destroy them.</p> <p>However, there is no scientific evidence to support this claim, and Rife 3D frequencies are not approved by any health authority as a treatment for any disease. <strong>Therefore, you should not rely on them as a substitute for conventional medicine</strong>, and you should always consult your doctor before trying them.</p> <p>If you decide to use Rife 3D frequencies for abscesses, you should follow the instructions carefully and take precautions to avoid any side effects or complications. You should also monitor your condition closely and seek medical help if needed.</p> <p>We hope this blog post has been informative and helpful for you.
