It can cause inflammation, redness, pimples, and scars on the face and other parts of the body. Acne can also affect one’s self-esteem and mental health.</p> <p>There are many treatments available for acne, such as creams, antibiotics, hormones, and lasers. However, some of these treatments may have side effects, be expensive, or not work for everyone. That’s why some people look for alternative or complementary therapies, such as Rife 3D frequencies.</p> <p>Rife 3D frequencies are a type of sound therapy that uses specific frequencies to target different health conditions. They are based on the work of Dr. Royal Raymond Rife, who claimed that he could cure diseases by destroying their microorganisms with resonant frequencies.</p> <p>Rife 3D frequencies are not proven by scientific evidence and may not be safe or effective for everyone. They should not replace any medical advice or treatment from your doctor. If you have any health concerns or questions, please consult your doctor before using Rife 3D frequencies.</p> <p>To use Rife 3D frequencies for acne relief, you will need a device that can generate and play the frequencies, such as a computer, a smartphone, or a speaker. You will also need a preset that contains the frequencies for acne. A preset is a file that has a list of frequencies and their durations.</p> <p>One example of a preset for acne is:</p> <p>Acne Rife 3D frequencies</p> <p>This is Rife 3D frequencies preset for mental relief from Acne (run 564 for 6 min). The frequencies in this preset are: 2720 hz, 2170 hz, 1800 hz, 1600 hz, 1550 hz, 1552 hz, 1500 hz, 802 hz, 880 hz, 778 hz, 787 hz, 760 hz, 741 hz, 727 hz, 660 hz, 564 hz, 465 hz, 450 hz, 444 hz, 428 hz</p> <p>To use this preset, you will need to visit <a href="https://brain-beats.in">brain beats</a> to your device. Then go the the rife 3D machine and search this preset there from the search box. You will also need to connect your device to a speaker or headphones.</p> <p>Once you have everything ready, you can start playing the preset. You should listen to it at a comfortable volume level and in a quiet environment. You can close your eyes and relax while listening to the frequencies. You can also visualize your skin healing and clearing up.</p> <p>You should run the preset for the duration specified in the description. You can repeat the preset as often as you like or as recommended by the creator. However, you should not overdo it or expect immediate results. Rife 3D frequencies are not a magic cure and may take time to work.</p> <p>You should also monitor your skin condition and any changes or reactions that may occur. If you notice any improvement or worsening of your acne or any other symptoms, you should stop using the preset and contact your doctor.</p> <p>Disclaimer: This blog post is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice. Rife 3D frequencies are not approved by the FDA or any other regulatory agency and may not be safe or effective for everyone. Please consult your doctor before using Rife 3D frequencies or any other alternative therapy for acne or any other health condition.</p> </div> </article> </main> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="text-center"> <ul> <li><a href="mailto:brainbeats@protonmail.com"><i title="email" class="fa-solid fa-envelope"></i></a></li> <li><a href="https://brain-beats.in/blog/blog/atom.xml"><i title="RSS" class="fa-solid fa-square-rss"></i></a></li> </ul> </footer> <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.1.min.js" integrity="sha256-o88AwQnZB+VDvE9tvIXrMQaPlFFSUTR+nldQm1LuPXQ=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.0/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-A3rJD856KowSb7dwlZdYEkO39Gagi7vIsF0jrRAoQmDKKtQBHUuLZ9AsSv4jD4Xa" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://brain-beats.in/blog/js/main.js"></script> </body> </html>
