In this blog post, I will share with you the benefits of listening to a pure tone of 157.43 Hz, which is one of the sacred frequencies that can activate and balance your sacral chakra.</p> <h2 id="what-is-the-sacral-chakra">What is the sacral chakra?</h2> <p>The sacral chakra, or Svadhisthana in Sanskrit, is the second of the seven main energy centers in your body. It is located just below your navel, in the area of your lower abdomen and reproductive organs. It is associated with the element of water, the color orange, and the sense of taste.</p> <p>The sacral chakra governs your emotions, sexuality, creativity, pleasure and relationships. When it is open and balanced, you feel confident, expressive, sensual, playful and joyful. You have a healthy relationship with yourself and others, and you can create and enjoy life to the fullest.</p> <p>However, when your sacral chakra is blocked or imbalanced, you may experience emotional instability, guilt, shame, fear, addiction, repression, frustration or depression. You may also have physical issues such as lower back pain, urinary tract infections, infertility or sexual dysfunction.</p> <h2 id="how-can-15743-hz-help-your-sacral-chakra">How can 157.43 Hz help your sacral chakra?</h2> <p>One of the ways to heal and balance your sacral chakra is to use sound therapy.
