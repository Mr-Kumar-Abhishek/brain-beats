They can cause pain, swelling, redness, fever, and sometimes serious complications.</p> <p>One of the alternative treatments that some people use for abscesses secondary is Rife 3D frequencies. Rife 3D frequencies are based on the idea that different frequencies of sound can affect the cells and organs of the body, and that some frequencies can kill harmful pathogens or stimulate healing processes.</p> <p>Rife 3D frequencies are generated by a device called a Rife machine, which emits sound waves through electrodes attached to the skin or through speakers. The Rife machine can be programmed with different presets, which are combinations of frequencies that target specific conditions or symptoms.</p> <p>In this blog post, I will show you how to use Rife 3D frequencies preset for mental relief from abscesses secondary. This preset contains the following frequencies: 1550 hz, 802 hz, 760 hz, 660 hz, 465 hz, 450 hz, 444 hz, 428 hz. These frequencies are said to have anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antibacterial, antiviral, and immune-boosting effects.</p> <h2 id="step-1-prepare-your-rife-machine-and-your-environment">Step 1: Prepare your Rife machine and your environment</h2> <p>Before you start using Rife 3D frequencies, you need to make sure that your Rife machine is working properly and that you have a comfortable and quiet environment. You will need:</p> <ul> <li>A Brain Beats Rife machine that can generate Rife 3D frequencies. You can use it online or build your own from a the generator. Make sure that it has the preset for abscesses secondary or that you can program it manually with the frequencies listed above.</li> <li>Speakers to deliver the sound waves to your body. If you use speakers, you will need to place them close to your ears or around your head.</li> <li>A timer or a stopwatch to keep track of the duration of each session.</li> <li>A comfortable chair or bed where you can relax and listen to the sound waves.</li> <li>A dim light or a blindfold to block out any visual distractions.</li> <li>A glass of water to drink before and after each session.</li> </ul> <h2 id="step-2-start-the-session-and-listen-to-the-sound-waves">Step 2: Start the session and listen to the sound waves</h2> <p>Once you have everything ready, you can start the session and listen to the sound waves. You will need to:</p> <ul> <li>Turn on your Rife machine and select the preset for abscesses secondary or enter the frequencies manually.</li> <li>Adjust the volume of the sound waves to a level that is comfortable for you. You should be able to hear them clearly but not too loudly.</li> <li>Set your timer or stopwatch for 15 minutes. This is the recommended duration for each session, but you can adjust it according to your preference and tolerance.</li> <li>Sit or lie down in a comfortable position and close your eyes or put on your blindfold.</li> <li>Relax your mind and body and focus on your breathing. Try not to think about anything else but the sound waves and how they make you feel.</li> <li>If you feel any discomfort, pain, nausea, dizziness, or other negative reactions during the session, stop immediately and consult your doctor.</li> </ul> <h2 id="step-3-end-the-session-and-drink-some-water">Step 3: End the session and drink some water</h2> <p>When your timer or stopwatch goes off, you can end the session and drink some water. You will need to:</p> <ul> <li>Turn off your Rife machine and remove the electrodes or speakers from your body or ears.</li> <li>Drink a glass of water to hydrate yourself and flush out any toxins that may have been released by the sound waves.</li> <li>Rest for a few minutes and observe how you feel. You may notice some changes in your mood, energy level, pain level, or infection status.</li> <li>Repeat the session once or twice a day until you see improvement in your condition. You can also combine Rife 3D frequencies with other treatments such as antibiotics, herbal remedies, or homeopathy.</li> </ul> <h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2> <p><strong>Rife 3D frequencies are not a substitute for medical advice or treatment.</strong> They are not proven by scientific research and may not work for everyone. They may also have side effects or interactions with other medications or devices. Always consult your doctor before using Rife 3D frequencies or any other alternative therapy for abscesses secondary or any other condition.</p> </div> </article> </main> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="text-center"> <ul> <li><a href="mailto:brainbeats@protonmail.com"><i title="email" class="fa-solid fa-envelope"></i></a></li> <li><a href="https://brain-beats.in/blog/blog/atom.xml"><i title="RSS" class="fa-solid fa-square-rss"></i></a></li> </ul> </footer> <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.1.min.js" integrity="sha256-o88AwQnZB+VDvE9tvIXrMQaPlFFSUTR+nldQm1LuPXQ=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.0/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-A3rJD856KowSb7dwlZdYEkO39Gagi7vIsF0jrRAoQmDKKtQBHUuLZ9AsSv4jD4Xa" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://brain-beats.in/blog/js/main.js"></script> </body> </html>
