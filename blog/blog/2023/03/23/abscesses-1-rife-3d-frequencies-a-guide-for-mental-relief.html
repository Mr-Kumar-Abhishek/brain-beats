Abscesses are pus-filled infections that can occur anywhere in the body, but are most common in the skin, gums, or teeth. They can cause swelling, inflammation, fever, and discomfort.</p> <p>One of the ways to treat abscesses is to use Rife 3D frequencies. Rife 3D frequencies are sound waves that are designed to target and destroy harmful microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. Rife 3D frequencies are based on the work of Dr. Royal Raymond Rife, who discovered that every microorganism has a specific frequency that can be used to kill it.</p> <p>Rife 3D frequencies are not only effective for physical healing, but also for mental relief. By using Rife 3D frequencies, you can reduce stress, anxiety, depression, and negative emotions that may be associated with abscesses. Rife 3D frequencies can also enhance your mood, energy, focus, and creativity.</p> <p>In this blog post, I will share with you a preset of Rife 3D frequencies that I have personally used for mental relief from abscesses 1. This preset contains 17 frequencies that range from 190 hz to 2720 hz. These frequencies are:</p> <ul> <li>2720 hz: This frequency is good for general detoxification and cleansing of the body.
