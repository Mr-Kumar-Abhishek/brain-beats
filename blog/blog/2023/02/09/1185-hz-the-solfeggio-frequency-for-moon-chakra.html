They are a set of musical tones that were originally derived from a medieval hymn and are said to have healing and spiritual benefits. Each frequency corresponds to a different aspect of our physical, mental and emotional well-being.</p> <p>One of these frequencies is 1185 Hz, which is associated with the moon chakra, also known as the lunar chakra, the bindu chakra or the mouth of God. This chakra is located at the back of the head, where the skull meets the neck. It is a minor chakra that is often overlooked, but it has a powerful influence on our life.</p> <p>The moon chakra is the gateway to our higher consciousness and intuition. It connects us with our soul purpose and our past lives. It also helps us to communicate with our spirit guides, such as angels, fairies and other benevolent beings. The moon chakra is the source of our creativity, sensitivity, femininity and anima (the feminine aspect of the psyche).</p> <p>When the moon chakra is balanced, we feel inspired, joyful, compassionate and in tune with our divine nature. We can access our inner wisdom and guidance, and we can express ourselves freely and authentically. We also experience a sense of youthfulness, vitality and health.</p> <p>However, when the moon chakra is blocked or imbalanced, we may feel disconnected from our true self and our higher power. We may struggle with issues such as depression, anxiety, confusion, isolation, fear, guilt or shame. We may also suffer from physical problems such as headaches, insomnia, hormonal imbalances or chronic fatigue.</p> <p>One way to heal and activate the moon chakra is to use the solfeggio frequency of 1185 Hz. This frequency resonates with the energy of the moon and helps to harmonize our lunar chakra. By listening to this frequency, we can clear any negative or stagnant energy from this chakra and restore its natural flow.</p> <p>You can find many videos and audios online that use the 1185 Hz frequency in different ways. Some may combine it with music, binaural beats, affirmations or subliminal messages. You can choose whatever suits your preference and intention.</p> <p>To get the most out of this frequency, you should listen to it with headphones or earphones in a quiet and comfortable place. You can also meditate while listening to it or simply relax and let it wash over you. You may want to focus on your moon chakra and visualize a silver-white light filling it with love and healing.</p> <p>As you listen to the 1185 Hz frequency, you may experience some sensations or emotions in your body or mind. This is normal and indicates that the frequency is working on your chakra. You may feel tingling, warmth, coldness, pressure, vibration or pulsation in your head or neck area. You may also feel waves of joy, peace, gratitude or bliss. You may even receive some insights, messages or visions from your spirit guides or higher self.</p> <p>The effects of the 1185 Hz frequency may vary from person to person and depend on your level of awareness and sensitivity. Some people may notice immediate changes while others may need more time and repetition. The key is to be patient and trust the process.</p> <p>The 1185 Hz frequency is a powerful tool to enhance your spiritual growth and well-being. By using it regularly, you can awaken your moon chakra and tap into your infinite potential. You can also share this frequency with others who may benefit from it and spread the light and love in the world.</p> </div> </article> </main> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="text-center"> <ul> <li><a href="mailto:brainbeats@protonmail.com"><i title="email" class="fa-solid fa-envelope"></i></a></li> <li><a href="https://brain-beats.in/blog/blog/atom.xml"><i title="RSS" class="fa-solid fa-square-rss"></i></a></li> </ul> </footer> <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.1.min.js" integrity="sha256-o88AwQnZB+VDvE9tvIXrMQaPlFFSUTR+nldQm1LuPXQ=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.0/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-A3rJD856KowSb7dwlZdYEkO39Gagi7vIsF0jrRAoQmDKKtQBHUuLZ9AsSv4jD4Xa" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://brain-beats.in/blog/js/main.js"></script> </body> </html>
