It is a lesser-known energy center that lies between the throat and the third eye chakras. It is associated with the color silver, which represents a high vibration of spiritual energy. The mouth chakra is responsible for expressing your higher purpose, leading by example, and manifesting depth, charisma and wisdom.</p> <p>However, many people have a blocked or imbalanced mouth chakra, which can cause them to lose sight of their higher purpose, feel lonely and cut off from the world, and be locked in their mind and out of touch with their heart and intuition. This can lead to a lack of fulfillment, joy and meaning in life.</p> <p>One way to activate and balance your mouth chakra is to use the 762 Hz solfeggio frequency. This is a sound frequency that resonates with the mouth chakra and helps to clear any blockages, harmonize the energy flow, and enhance the qualities of this chakra.</p> <p>The 762 Hz solfeggio frequency can be listened to as a pure tone, or as part of a music track that incorporates this frequency. You can find many examples of such tracks on YouTube or other platforms. You can also use a tuning fork or a singing bowl that produces this frequency.</p> <p>To use the 762 Hz solfeggio frequency for your mouth chakra, you can follow these steps:</p> <ul> <li>Find a comfortable and quiet place where you will not be disturbed.</li> <li>Sit or lie down and relax your body and mind.</li> <li>Set an intention to activate and balance your mouth chakra with the 762 Hz solfeggio frequency.</li> <li>Play the sound or music track that contains the 762 Hz solfeggio frequency, or use your tuning fork or singing bowl to produce this sound.</li> <li>Close your eyes and focus on your mouth chakra, which is located between your throat and your forehead. Visualize a silver light glowing in this area.</li> <li>Breathe deeply and slowly, and allow the sound to penetrate your mouth chakra. Feel the vibration of the sound clearing any blockages, harmonizing the energy flow, and enhancing the qualities of this chakra.</li> <li> <p>Repeat positive affirmations that resonate with your mouth chakra, such as:</p> <ul> <li>I express my higher purpose with clarity and confidence.</li> <li>I lead by example and inspire others with my wisdom and charisma.</li> <li>I manifest depth, joy and meaning in my life.</li> <li>I am connected to my heart and intuition, and I trust my inner guidance.</li> <li>I am open to receive divine inspiration and guidance.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Continue this practice for as long as you feel comfortable, or until the sound or music track ends.</li> <li>When you are done, thank yourself for taking this time to activate and balance your mouth chakra. Open your eyes and notice how you feel. You may feel more calm, centered, aligned, inspired, or joyful.</li> </ul> <p>You can repeat this practice as often as you like, or whenever you feel the need to activate and balance your mouth chakra. You can also combine it with other methods of chakra healing, such as meditation, yoga, crystals, aromatherapy, or Reiki.</p> <p>By activating and balancing your mouth chakra with the 762 Hz solfeggio frequency, you can enhance your ability to express your higher purpose, lead by example, manifest depth, charisma and wisdom, and connect with your heart and intuition. This can help you live a more fulfilling, joyful and meaningful life.</p> </div> </article> </main> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="text-center"> <ul> <li><a href="mailto:brainbeats@protonmail.com"><i title="email" class="fa-solid fa-envelope"></i></a></li> <li><a href="https://brain-beats.in/blog/blog/atom.xml"><i title="RSS" class="fa-solid fa-square-rss"></i></a></li> </ul> </footer> <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.1.min.js" integrity="sha256-o88AwQnZB+VDvE9tvIXrMQaPlFFSUTR+nldQm1LuPXQ=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.0/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-A3rJD856KowSb7dwlZdYEkO39Gagi7vIsF0jrRAoQmDKKtQBHUuLZ9AsSv4jD4Xa" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://brain-beats.in/blog/js/main.js"></script> </body> </html>
