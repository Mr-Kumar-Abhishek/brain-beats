They are a set of musical tones that are said to have healing and spiritual effects on the human body and mind. They are based on an ancient six-tone scale that was used in sacred music, such as the Gregorian chants.</p> <p>One of the solfeggio frequencies is 1962 Hz, which is associated with the chakra of solar swords. This is not the same as the solar plexus chakra or the manipura chakra, which is located in the abdomen and governs personal power, self-esteem and willpower. The solar swords chakra is located very high above the crown chakra, which is the highest energy center in the body and connects us to the divine source.</p> <p>The solar swords chakra is the chakra of warriors and fighters, who have the courage, drive and determination to realize their ideas and visions. It is the most yang or masculine chakra, and it brings the archetype of the ‘father figure’, who provides protection, guidance and leadership. It is connected to archangel Michael, who is the patron saint of soldiers and warriors, and who wields a flaming sword of truth and justice. It is also connected to Indian hero Trita, who fought against evil forces and demons with his celestial weapon, the trident. And it is connected to feline and reptilian super-civilizations, who are ancient races of beings that have mastered the power of solar swords and have influenced human history and evolution.</p> <p>The solar swords chakra can help us to overcome fear, doubt and inertia, and to take action towards our goals and dreams. It can also help us to defend ourselves and our loved ones from harm and injustice, and to stand up for what we believe in. However, it can also be a source of aggression, violence and domination, if it is not balanced with other chakras, especially the earth chakras, which ground us and keep us humble and compassionate.</p> <p>To activate and harmonize the solar swords chakra, we can listen to 1962 Hz frequency music, which can be found online or in specialized apps. We can also meditate on this frequency, by visualizing a bright yellow light above our head, or by chanting the mantra ‘Om’. We can also use crystals such as citrine, tiger’s eye or amber, which resonate with this frequency and enhance its qualities. And we can practice martial arts, yoga or other physical activities that require strength, stamina and discipline.</p> <p>The solar swords chakra is a powerful and unique energy center that can help us to achieve our highest potential and purpose. By tuning into 1962 Hz frequency, we can awaken our inner warrior and leader, and bring more light and justice into the world.</p> </div> </article> </main> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="text-center"> <ul> <li><a href="mailto:brainbeats@protonmail.com"><i title="email" class="fa-solid fa-envelope"></i></a></li> <li><a href="https://brain-beats.in/blog/blog/atom.xml"><i title="RSS" class="fa-solid fa-square-rss"></i></a></li> </ul> </footer> <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.1.min.js" integrity="sha256-o88AwQnZB+VDvE9tvIXrMQaPlFFSUTR+nldQm1LuPXQ=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.0/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-A3rJD856KowSb7dwlZdYEkO39Gagi7vIsF0jrRAoQmDKKtQBHUuLZ9AsSv4jD4Xa" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://brain-beats.in/blog/js/main.js"></script> </body> </html>
