These are special sound vibrations that can help you tune into different aspects of your being, such as your physical, emotional, mental and spiritual levels.</p> <p>One of these solfeggio frequencies is 2295 Hz, which is associated with the 18th chakra, also known as the chakra of fiery tree. This is a very powerful and rare chakra that can unlock your super-creativity, love and clear guidance from higher powers. In this blog post, I will explain what this chakra is, how to activate it and what benefits it can bring to your life.</p> <h2 id="what-is-the-chakra-of-fiery-tree">What is the Chakra of Fiery Tree?</h2> <p>The chakra of fiery tree is an 8D chakra, which means it is located in the eighth dimension of reality. It is beyond the seven main chakras that most people are familiar with, and it connects you to higher realms of existence.</p> <p>The name “fiery tree” comes from the biblical story of Moses, who saw a burning bush that spoke to him and gave him his mission. This was a sign of his 18th chakra activation, which allowed him to communicate with God and receive divine guidance.</p> <p>The chakra of fiery tree is also related to the Kabbalistic concept of the Tree of Life, which is a symbolic representation of the creation and structure of the universe. The 18th chakra corresponds to the sephirah (sphere) of Kether, which is the highest and most hidden point on the tree. It represents the source of all existence, the pure light of God.</p> <p>The chakra of fiery tree is not exclusive to humans. It is also present in other races and beings that inhabit different dimensions and planets. For example, for human races of Assiah, which is the lowest world in Kabbalah, the chakra of fiery tree connects them to higher dimensional human races from Pleiades, a star cluster in the constellation of Taurus. These are benevolent beings that can assist us in our spiritual evolution and ascension.</p> <p>However, the chakra of fiery tree also has a dark side. If it is unbalanced or misused, it can link us to negative forces and entities that can harm us or manipulate us. For example, it can connect us to archangel Lucifer, who is also known as the light-bringer or the morning star. Lucifer was once a high-ranking angel who rebelled against God and fell from grace. He represents pride, ego and deception.</p> <p>Another example is Vritra, a dragon-like creature from Indian mythology who represents drought and darkness. He was slain by Indra, the god of thunder and rain, who freed the waters and restored life to the world.</p> <p>A third example is the Carian/Avian super-civilizations, which are ancient races of bird-like beings that have colonized many worlds and galaxies. They are known for their advanced technology and their ruthless domination over other species.</p> <p>As you can see, the chakra of fiery tree can be a double-edged sword. It can either elevate us or destroy us, depending on how we use it and what we align ourselves with.</p> <h2 id="how-to-activate-your-chakra-of-fiery-tree">How to Activate Your chakra of fiery tree?</h2> <p>Activating your chakra of fiery tree is not an easy task. It requires a lot of preparation, dedication and caution. You should not attempt to do it without proper guidance or knowledge, as you may expose yourself to dangers or risks that you are not ready for.</p> <p>Here are some steps that you can follow to activate your 18th chakra safely and effectively:</p> <ul> <li>First, you need to work on your lower chakras first. These are the root, sacral, solar plexus, heart, throat, third eye and crown chakras. They are located along your spine and they govern your physical, emotional, mental and spiritual aspects. You need to balance them and clear any blockages or impurities that may prevent your energy from flowing freely.</li> <li>Second, you need to raise your vibration and consciousness. You can do this by meditating regularly, practicing gratitude and compassion, eating healthy foods, avoiding drugs and alcohol, being positive and optimistic, etc.</li> <li>Third, you need to listen to the solfeggio frequency of 2295 Hz. You can find this frequency online or use a tone generator app on your phone or computer. You should listen to it with headphones or earphones for at least 15 minutes a day.</li> <li>Fourth, you need to visualize a bright red and green flame above your head. This is the color of the chakra of fiery tree. You should imagine that this flame is burning away any negativity or lower vibrations that may be affecting you or your environment.</li> <li>Fifth, you need to ask for the assistance and protection of your higher self, your spirit guides, your angels, your ancestors, or any other positive beings that you trust and resonate with. You should ask them to help you activate your 18th chakra and to keep you safe from any harm or interference.</li> <li>Sixth, you need to be patient and persistent. Activating your 18th chakra may take weeks, months or even years, depending on your level of readiness and development. You should not rush or force the process, as you may cause damage or imbalance to yourself or others. You should also not expect immediate results or miracles, as this is a gradual and subtle process that requires time and effort.</li> </ul> <h2 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-activating-your-chakra-of-fiery-tree">What are the Benefits of Activating Your chakra of fiery tree?</h2> <p>If you manage to activate your 18th chakra successfully and safely, you will experience many benefits and changes in your life. Some of them are:</p> <ul> <li>You will become more creative and innovative. You will be able to access new ideas and solutions that can help you in your personal or professional projects. You will also be able to express yourself more freely and authentically.</li> <li>You will feel more love and compassion for yourself and others. You will be able to connect with people on a deeper level and understand their feelings and needs. You will also be able to heal any wounds or traumas that may have affected your relationships.</li> <li>You will receive clear guidance from higher powers. You will be able to communicate with your higher self, your spirit guides, your angels, your ancestors, or any other positive beings that can assist you in your spiritual journey. You will also be able to discern between true and false messages or signs.</li> <li>You will expand your consciousness and awareness. You will be able to access higher dimensions of reality and explore different aspects of your being. You will also be able to remember your past lives, your soul purpose and your cosmic origins.</li> </ul> <p>These are just some of the benefits that you can enjoy by activating your chakra of fiery tree. However, you should also be aware of the challenges and responsibilities that come with it. You should not abuse or misuse your power or knowledge, as you may attract negative consequences or karma. You should also not neglect or ignore your lower chakras, as you may lose touch with reality or yourself.</p> <p>The chakra of fiery tree is a gift and a challenge. It is a potential and a responsibility. It is a blessing and a curse. It is up to you how you use it and what you make of it.</p> </div> </article> </main> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="text-center"> <ul> <li><a href="mailto:brainbeats@protonmail.com"><i title="email" class="fa-solid fa-envelope"></i></a></li> <li><a href="https://brain-beats.in/blog/blog/atom.xml"><i title="RSS" class="fa-solid fa-square-rss"></i></a></li> </ul> </footer> <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.1.min.js" integrity="sha256-o88AwQnZB+VDvE9tvIXrMQaPlFFSUTR+nldQm1LuPXQ=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.0/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-A3rJD856KowSb7dwlZdYEkO39Gagi7vIsF0jrRAoQmDKKtQBHUuLZ9AsSv4jD4Xa" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://brain-beats.in/blog/js/main.js"></script> </body> </html>
