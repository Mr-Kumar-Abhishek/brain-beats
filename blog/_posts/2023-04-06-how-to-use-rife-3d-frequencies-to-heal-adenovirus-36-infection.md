Adenovirus 36 (AD-36) is a type of virus that can cause respiratory infections, conjunctivitis, and gastroenteritis. Some studies have also suggested that AD-36 may be related to weight gain in some people, as it can affect the metabolism and fat storage of cells.

Rife 3D frequencies are a form of sound therapy that uses specific frequencies to target and destroy pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Rife 3D frequencies are based on the work of Dr. Royal Raymond Rife, who discovered that each microorganism has a unique frequency that can be used to kill it without harming the surrounding healthy tissue.

In this blog post, I will show you how to use Rife 3D frequencies to heal AD-36 infection and possibly reduce its effects on your weight. You will need a device that can generate Rife 3D frequencies, such as a Spooky2 generator or a Brain Beats. You will also need a pair of headphones or speakers to listen to the frequencies.

The frequencies that I will use in this preset are:

- 8875 hz: This is the main frequency for AD-36, according to the Consolidated Annotated Frequency List (CAFL).
- 6140 hz: This is a secondary frequency for AD-36, also from the CAFL.
- 5859 hz: This is a frequency for weight loss, according to the Spooky2 database.
- 5797 hz: This is another frequency for weight loss, also from the Spooky2 database.
- 5219 hz: This is a frequency for fat metabolism, according to the Spooky2 database.

To use this preset, follow these steps:

1. Connect your device to your computer and load the preset file. You can play the preset file from this website: [brain beats](https://brain-beats.in)
2. Plug in your headphones or speakers and adjust the volume to a comfortable level. You should be able to hear the frequencies clearly, but not too loud.
3. Start the program and listen to the frequencies for at least 30 minutes per day. You can listen longer if you wish, but do not exceed 2 hours per day.
4. Repeat this process daily until your symptoms improve or disappear. You may also notice changes in your weight or body fat percentage over time.

Note: This preset is not a substitute for proper medical diagnosis and treatment. If you have any serious or chronic health conditions, please consult your doctor before using Rife 3D frequencies. Some people may experience side effects such as headache, nausea, fatigue, or detoxification symptoms when using Rife 3D frequencies. If this happens, stop the program and drink plenty of water. Resume the program when you feel better or lower the volume or duration of the sessions.
