Adhesions are bands of scar tissue that form between organs and tissues, causing pain, inflammation, and reduced mobility. They can result from surgery, infection, trauma, or inflammation. Adhesions can affect any part of the body, but they are most common in the abdomen, pelvis, and chest.

One of the possible ways to treat adhesions is to use Rife 3D frequencies. Rife 3D frequencies are sound waves that are modulated in three dimensions to create a holographic effect. They are based on the work of Dr. Royal Raymond Rife, who discovered that certain frequencies can destroy harmful microorganisms and stimulate healing.

Rife 3D frequencies are different from traditional Rife frequencies, which are usually single tones or simple waveforms. Rife 3D frequencies are complex and dynamic, creating a more immersive and effective experience. They can also target multiple issues at once, as each frequency has multiple harmonics and subharmonics.

To use Rife 3D frequencies for adhesions, you will need a device that can generate and play them. There are several options available on the market, such as the Spooky2 Rife Machine, the GB4000 Frequency Generator, the F-Scan Frequency Synthesizer or [brain beats](https://brain-beats.in). You will also need a pair of headphones or speakers to listen to the frequencies.

The following is a sample healing preset for adhesions using Rife 3D frequencies. You can adjust the duration, intensity, and volume according to your preference and tolerance. You can also add or remove frequencies as needed.

- 2720 hz - This frequency helps to dissolve scar tissue and adhesions, as well as to reduce inflammation and pain.

- 2170 hz - This frequency helps to improve blood circulation and oxygen delivery to the affected areas, as well as to stimulate cellular regeneration and repair.

- 1550 hz - This frequency helps to balance the immune system and fight off infections that may cause or worsen adhesions.

- 802 hz - This frequency helps to relax the muscles and nerves around the adhesions, as well as to relieve spasms and cramps.

- 880 hz - This frequency helps to enhance the healing process and promote tissue growth and regeneration.

- 787 hz - This frequency helps to boost the overall health and vitality of the body, as well as to support the organs and systems affected by adhesions.

- 776 hz - This frequency helps to cleanse and detoxify the body from toxins and waste products that may contribute to adhesions.

- 760 hz - This frequency helps to reduce stress and anxiety that may aggravate adhesions.

- 727 hz - This frequency helps to eliminate bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites that may cause or worsen adhesions.

- 660 hz - This frequency helps to harmonize the energy flow and balance the chakras in the body, as well as to enhance mental clarity and focus.

- 190 hz - This frequency helps to ground and center the body and mind, as well as to calm the emotions and release negative feelings.

To use this preset, simply play it on your device for at least 15 minutes a day, preferably before bedtime. You can also listen to it while meditating, doing yoga, or performing other relaxing activities. You should notice some improvement in your symptoms within a few weeks of consistent use.
