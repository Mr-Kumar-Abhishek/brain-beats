If you are interested in sound healing, you may have heard of solfeggio frequencies. These are a set of tones that are believed to have beneficial effects on the body, mind and spirit. One of these frequencies is 618 Hz, which is associated with the lower heart chakra.

The lower heart chakra, also known as the etheric heart chakra, is located below the heart chakra and above the solar plexus chakra. It is not one of the seven main chakras, but rather an additional one that some people believe exists in the subtle body. The lower heart chakra is related to the color peach, which is a combination of orange and pink.

The lower heart chakra is said to govern aspects of our life purpose, self-esteem and forgiveness. It also helps us balance our independence and dependence on others, as well as our practicality and creativity. When this chakra is active and well balanced, we can use our multifaceted talents in a focused way and apply discipline to achieve our goals. We can also express warmth, nurturing and compassion to ourselves and others.

However, when this chakra is not active or well balanced, we may experience issues such as low self-worth, resentment, guilt or shame. We may also swing from extreme dependence to extreme independence, or from being too rigid to being too chaotic. We may lack direction, motivation or organization in our lives.

One way to activate and balance the lower heart chakra is to use sound healing with the solfeggio frequency of 618 Hz. This frequency can help us tune into the energy of this chakra and harmonize it with the rest of our energy system. It can also help us release any negative emotions or patterns that are blocking this chakra from functioning optimally.

To use sound healing with 618 Hz, you can listen to music or tones that incorporate this frequency, or use a tuning fork or singing bowl that produces this sound. You can also chant or hum along with the sound, or simply focus on the vibration in your chest area. You can do this for as long as you feel comfortable, preferably in a quiet and relaxed environment.

Some benefits of using sound healing with 618 Hz for your lower heart chakra are:

- Enhanced self-confidence and self-esteem
- Increased clarity and direction in your life purpose
- Improved ability to forgive yourself and others
- More balanced relationships and interdependence
- Greater creativity and practicality
- Higher levels of joy, humor and laughter
