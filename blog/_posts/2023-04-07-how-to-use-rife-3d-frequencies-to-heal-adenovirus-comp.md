Adenovirus comp is a term used to describe a complex of adenoviruses, which are a group of viruses that can cause respiratory, gastrointestinal, and eye infections. Adenoviruses are very common and can affect anyone, but they are more likely to cause serious illness in people with weakened immune systems, such as children, elderly, or transplant recipients.

One of the alternative ways to treat adenovirus comp is to use Rife 3D frequencies, which are based on the work of Dr. Royal Raymond Rife, an American inventor who claimed to have discovered a way to destroy harmful microorganisms using sound waves. Rife 3D frequencies are generated by a device that emits soundwave pulses at specific frequencies that are supposed to resonate with and destroy the target pathogens.

In this blog post, I will show you how to use Rife 3D frequencies to heal adenovirus comp using a preset that I have created. This preset contains 40 frequencies that are based on the research of various Rife practitioners and enthusiasts. The frequencies in this preset are:

10000 hz, 7767 hz, 7762 hz, 7702 hz, 7009 hz, 7001 hz, 6989 hz, 5000 hz, 4868 hz, 2720 hz, 2050 hz, 1500 hz, 1395 hz, 1062 hz, 1060 hz, 1034 hz, 1009 hz, 969 hz, 968 hz, 962 hz, 959 hz, 960 hz, 952 hz, 951 hz, 942 hz, 880 hz, 1550 hz, 802 hz, 787 hz, 768 hz, 728 hz, 690 hz, 660 hz, 555 hz, 523 hz, 522 hz, 1865 hz, 444 hz, 333 hz, 300 hz, 180 hz, 160 hz, 125 hz, 95 hz, 72 hz, 60 hz, 48 hz, 26 hz, 20 hz

To use this preset, you will need a Rife software that can generate these frequencies and deliver them to your body. There are many types of Rife software available on the market. You will also need a software program that can control the device and run the preset. I recommend using  [brain beats website](https://brain-beats.in), which is free and compatible with most most speakers and headphones.

To run the preset, follow these steps:

1. Connect your Rife device to your computer and launch brain beats software.
2. Go to the 3D rife frequency section and search the name "adenovirus comp".
3. Click on play button on the preset.
4. Adjust the volume of the sound.
5. You could use headphones or directly speakers.
6. The preset will run indefinately. You can adjust the intensity of the frequencies according to your preference and tolerance.
7. Repeat the treatment once or twice a day until you feel better.

Some tips for using Rife frequencies:

- Drink plenty of water before and after the treatment to flush out toxins.
- Eat healthy foods and avoid sugar and processed foods that can feed the viruses.
- Take supplements that can boost your immune system and support your organs.
- Rest well and avoid stress as much as possible.
- Monitor your symptoms and consult your doctor if they worsen or persist.
