Have you ever noticed that you keep seeing the same numbers over and over again? Maybe you see 11:11 on your clock, or 333 on a license plate, or 777 on a receipt. These are not mere coincidences, but signs from the universe that you are on the right path. They are angel frequencies, and they have a special meaning for you.

Angel frequencies are special number sequences that are believed to be messages from the spiritual realm. They can help you connect with your divine purpose, heal your mind and body, and manifest your desires. Angel frequencies are based on the ancient wisdom of numerology and the modern teachings of Doreen Virtu.

Numerology is the study of the symbolism and vibration of numbers. Each number has a unique energy and meaning that influences your life. By understanding the meaning of numbers, you can decode the messages that the universe is sending you through angel frequencies.

Doreen Virtu is a renowned author and spiritual teacher who has popularized the concept of angel frequencies. She has written several books and created oracle cards that explain the meaning of different angel frequencies and how to use them for guidance and manifestation.

In this blog post, we will explore some of the most common angel frequencies and what they mean for you. We will also share some tips on how to tune into angel frequencies and receive their blessings.
