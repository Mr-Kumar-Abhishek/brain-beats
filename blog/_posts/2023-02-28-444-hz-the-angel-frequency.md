Have you ever wondered why some music sounds more heavenly than others? Why some songs make you feel closer to the divine? The answer may lie in the frequency of the sound waves, or the pitch of the notes. 

One of the most popular and widely used frequencies in music is 444 Hz, also known as the angel frequency. This frequency is said to have many spiritual and healing benefits, as well as being pleasing to the ear and the mind.

The frequency of 444 Hz is not a new invention. It has been used for centuries by various cultures and religions, especially in the Middle East. One of the most famous examples of this frequency is in the Psalms, the sacred songs of King David in the Bible.

This tuning system is based on simple ratios of whole numbers, and is considered to be more harmonious and natural than the modern tuning system known as equal temperament, which is based on complex fractions.

King David used his harp and his voice to praise God and to express his emotions. He also used them to heal himself and others from physical and mental illnesses. Some of his psalms are still sung today in churches and synagogues, and they have a powerful effect on the listeners.
