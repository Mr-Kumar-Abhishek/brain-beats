Have you ever wondered what it means to be connected with God? How can you experience the divine presence in your life? How can you co-create your reality with the source of all that is?

One way to explore these questions is to tune into the solfeggio frequency of 2406 Hz. This is a sound vibration that resonates with the one of upper chakras, the chakra of I AM. This chakra is associated with the concept of I AM, which is the essence of your connection with God.

The I AM is not a statement of ego, but a declaration of your true nature as a divine being. It is the recognition that you are not separate from God, but a part of God. It is the realization that you have a role to play in co-creating with the divine and to communicate through the radiance of light.

When you listen to the solfeggio frequency of 2406 Hz, you can activate and balance your soul star chakra and align yourself with the I AM. You can experience a sense of oneness, peace, joy, and gratitude. You can also access higher levels of consciousness, intuition, and wisdom.

The solfeggio frequency of 2406 Hz can help you to:

- Connect with your higher self and your soul purpose

To listen to the solfeggio frequency of 2406 Hz, you can use a tuning fork, a singing bowl, a sound healing device, or a meditation app such as [brain beats](https://brain-beats.in/solfeggio-frequency.html).
