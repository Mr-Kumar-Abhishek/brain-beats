Binaural beats are a type of sound that can induce different states of mind, such as relaxation, focus, creativity, or sleep. They are created by playing two slightly different frequencies in each ear, which the brain perceives as a single pulsing tone. The difference between the two frequencies determines the effect of the binaural beats on the brain.

For example, if you listen to a 200 Hz sound in your left ear and a 210 Hz sound in your right ear, your brain will perceive a 10 Hz binaural beat, which is in the alpha range. Alpha waves are associated with relaxed and alert states of mind, and can enhance learning and memory.

Binaural beats can be found on YouTube, where many creators upload videos with different types of binaural beats for various purposes. Some of the most popular categories are:

- Meditation: Binaural beats can help you enter a meditative state by synchronizing your brain waves with the desired frequency. For example, theta waves (4-8 Hz) are linked to deep meditation and intuition.
- Sleep: Binaural beats can also help you fall asleep faster and improve the quality of your sleep by inducing delta waves (0.5-4 Hz), which are the slowest and deepest brain waves that occur during deep sleep.
- Focus: Binaural beats can boost your concentration and productivity by stimulating beta waves (12-30 Hz), which are associated with alertness and problem-solving.
- Creativity: Binaural beats can also spark your creativity and imagination by generating gamma waves (30-100 Hz), which are the fastest and highest frequency brain waves that occur during peak performance and insight.

To listen to binaural beats on YouTube, you need a pair of headphones or earbuds, as the sounds need to be isolated in each ear. You also need to choose a video that matches your goal and preference, as different binaural beats have different effects and durations. You can use the search function or browse through the playlists to find what you are looking for.
