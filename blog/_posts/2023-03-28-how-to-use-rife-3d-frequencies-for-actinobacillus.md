Actinobacillus is a genus of bacteria that can cause various infections in mammals, such as respiratory, urinary, and reproductive diseases. Some of the most common species of Actinobacillus are A. actinomycetemcomitans, A. pleuropneumoniae, A. suis, and A. equuli. These bacteria can be difficult to treat with conventional antibiotics, and may lead to chronic or fatal conditions.

Fortunately, there is an alternative way to deal with Actinobacillus infections: Rife 3D frequencies. Rife 3D frequencies are sound waves that are designed to target and destroy specific pathogens by resonating with their molecular structure. Rife 3D frequencies are based on the work of Dr. Royal Raymond Rife, who discovered that every microorganism has a unique frequency that can be used to eliminate it without harming the surrounding tissue.

Rife 3D frequencies are different from the original Rife frequencies in that they use three-dimensional sound waves that can penetrate deeper into the body and reach the hidden locations of the bacteria. Rife 3D frequencies also use a higher range of frequencies that can cover more pathogens and enhance the healing effect.

In this blog post, I will show you how to use Rife 3D frequencies for Actinobacillus infections. I will also share with you a preset that I have created for mental relief from Actinobacillus, which can help you cope with the stress and anxiety caused by the infection.

## How to Use Rife 3D Frequencies for Actinobacillus

To use Rife 3D frequencies for Actinobacillus, you will need a device that can generate and play these frequencies, such as a Rife machine, a frequency generator, or a smartphone app. You will also need a pair of headphones or speakers that can produce high-quality sound.

The procedure is simple: you just need to select the frequency or preset that matches the Actinobacillus species that you want to target, and play it for the recommended duration and intensity. You can do this once or twice a day, depending on your condition and preference. You should also drink plenty of water before and after the session to help flush out the toxins released by the dying bacteria.

Here are some examples of Rife 3D frequencies for different Actinobacillus species:

- A. actinomycetemcomitans: 488 hz, 565 hz, 672 hz, 674 hz, 678 hz
- A. pleuropneumoniae: 773 hz, 766 hz, 768 hz
- A. suis: 776 hz, 777 hz
- A. equuli: 778 hz, 822 hz

You can also combine these frequencies to create your own custom preset for Actinobacillus.

## My Preset for Mental Relief from Actinobacillus

As I mentioned earlier, I have created a preset for mental relief from Actinobacillus, which can help you relax and calm your mind while fighting the infection. This preset uses some of the frequencies listed above, as well as some additional ones that have been shown to have positive effects on mood and cognition.

The frequencies in this preset are:

- 488 hz: This frequency is associated with clarity, awareness, and intuition.
- 565 hz: This frequency is linked to creativity, inspiration, and expression.
- 672 hz: This frequency is related to harmony, balance, and peace.
- 674 hz: This frequency is connected to joy, happiness, and optimism.
- 678 hz: This frequency is correlated with love, compassion, and empathy.
- 773 hz: This frequency is one of the Rife 3D frequencies for A. pleuropneumoniae.
- 766 hz: This frequency is another one of the Rife 3D frequencies for A. pleuropneumoniae.
- 768 hz: This frequency is also one of the Rife 3D frequencies for A. pleuropneumoniae.
- 776 hz: This frequency is one of the Rife 3D frequencies for A. suis.
- 777 hz: This frequency is another one of the Rife 3D frequencies for A. suis.
- 778 hz: This frequency is one of the Rife 3D frequencies for A. equuli.
- 822 hz: This frequency is another one of the Rife 3D frequencies for A. equuli.
- 885 hz: This frequency is associated with intuition, insight, and wisdom.
- 887 hz: This frequency is linked to self-confidence, self-esteem, and self-worth.
- 7877 hz: This frequency is related to mental clarity, focus, and concentration.
- 9687 hz: This frequency is connected to mental power, intelligence, and learning.
- 42664 hz: This frequency is correlated with spiritual awareness, enlightenment, and transcendence.
- 42666 hz: This frequency is also correlated with spiritual awareness, enlightenment, and transcendence.
- 46668 hz: This frequency is associated with cosmic consciousness, universal love, and unity.
- 46787 hz: This frequency is linked to divine guidance, protection, and healing.

To use this preset, you can play it for 15 to 30 minutes a day, at a comfortable volume. You can also use it as a background sound while meditating, reading, or doing other relaxing activities.
