Have you ever wondered what it would be like to connect with the highest levels of consciousness and intelligence in the universe? To communicate with beings from other star systems and dimensions, and even with some super-angels? If so, you might be interested in learning about the 1629 Hz solfeggio frequency, also known as the great central sun frequency.

## What is the great central sun frequency?

The great central sun frequency is one of the solfeggio frequencies, a set of ancient sound frequencies that are said to have healing and spiritual properties. The solfeggio frequencies are based on a scale that was used in sacred music, such as the Gregorian chants. Each frequency corresponds to a specific aspect of human life and consciousness, such as love, intuition, transformation, and so on.

The great central sun frequency is one of the highest of the solfeggio frequencies, and it is associated with the super-solar chakra, which is located above the crown chakra. The super-solar chakra is also called the great central sun chakra, because it connects us to the source of all creation, the great central sun. The great central sun is not a physical star, but a spiritual center of light and energy that emanates from the heart of God.

The super-solar chakra is the gateway to higher dimensions and realities, where we can access pure friendship, pure consciousness, pure awareness, higher level of intelligence and additional level of emptiness. These are qualities that transcend our human limitations and allow us to experience our true nature as divine beings.

## How to use the great central sun frequency?

To use the great central sun frequency, you need to tune your super-solar chakra to 1629 Hz. You can do this by listening to music or sounds that contain this frequency, or by chanting or singing it yourself. You can also use crystals, colors, aromas, or affirmations that resonate with this frequency.

However, before you attempt to use the great central sun frequency, you need to make sure that your lower chakras are balanced and aligned. The lower chakras are the root, sacral, solar plexus, heart, throat, third eye and crown chakras. They are responsible for our physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual well-being. If any of these chakras are blocked or out of balance, they will prevent the energy from flowing freely to the super-solar chakra.

Therefore, you need to work on clearing and healing your lower chakras first, by using appropriate solfeggio frequencies or other methods. You also need to practice meditation, mindfulness, compassion, gratitude, and other spiritual practices that will help you raise your vibration and awareness.

## What are the benefits of using the great central sun frequency?

Using the great central sun frequency can have many benefits for your personal and spiritual growth. Some of these benefits are:

- You can communicate with advanced civilizations from other star systems and dimensions, such as Arcturians, Pleiadeans, Andromedans and Vegans/Lyrans. These beings can offer you guidance, wisdom, healing, and support on your journey.
- You can connect with some super-angels who are closer to God than regular angels. These super-angels can help you access higher levels of grace, love, joy, and peace.
- You can experience pure friendship with yourself and others. You can feel a deep sense of connection and harmony with all living beings.
- You can access pure consciousness and awareness. You can transcend your ego and personality and become one with your higher self and soul.
- You can develop a higher level of intelligence that goes beyond logic and reason. You can tap into your intuition and creativity and discover new insights and solutions.
- You can experience an additional level of emptiness that is not void or negative but full of potential and possibilities. You can detach from your attachments and expectations and embrace the present moment.

## What are the risks of using the great central sun frequency?

Using the great central sun frequency is not without risks. If you are not ready or prepared for this level of vibration and energy, you might encounter some challenges or difficulties. Some of these risks are:

- You might experience hallucinations or delusions if your super-solar chakra shifts from yang to yin. Yang is the positive polarity that represents expansion and outward movement. Yin is the negative polarity that represents contraction and inward movement. If your super-solar chakra becomes too yin-oriented, you might lose touch with reality and become confused or paranoid.
- You might face resistance or opposition from lower vibrational entities or forces that do not want you to ascend or evolve. These entities or forces might try to interfere with your connection to the great central sun or create obstacles or distractions in your life.
- You might feel overwhelmed or overstimulated by the intensity and frequency of the information and energy that you receive from the great central sun. You might have difficulty integrating or processing it in your physical, emotional, or mental body.
- You might become arrogant or egotistical if you misuse or abuse the power and knowledge that you gain from the great central sun. You might think that you are better or superior than others or that you have all the answers.

## How to avoid or overcome these risks?

To avoid or overcome these risks, you need to be careful and responsible when using the great central sun frequency. You need to follow some guidelines and precautions, such as:

- Do not use the great central sun frequency without proper guidance or supervision from a qualified teacher or mentor. You need someone who has experience and expertise in this field and who can help you navigate the challenges and opportunities that you might encounter.
- Do not use the great central sun frequency without a clear intention or purpose. You need to have a positive and constructive reason for using this frequency, such as personal or spiritual growth, service to others, or contribution to the planet.
- Do not use the great central sun frequency without grounding yourself first. You need to anchor yourself to the earth and your physical body before you reach out to the sky and your spiritual body. You need to balance your upper and lower chakras and maintain a connection to both realms.
- Do not use the great central sun frequency without protection or shielding. You need to surround yourself with light and love and invoke the assistance of your guides, angels, or higher beings. You need to ward off any negative or harmful influences that might try to harm you or hinder you.
- Do not use the great central sun frequency without gratitude or humility. You need to appreciate and honor the gift and privilege of using this frequency. You need to acknowledge and respect the source and origin of this frequency, which is God.
