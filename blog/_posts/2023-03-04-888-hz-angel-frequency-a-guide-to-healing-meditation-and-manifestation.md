One of the best ways to experience the benefits of the 888 Hz frequency is to use it for meditation and manifestation.

Manifestation is a process of using your thoughts, emotions and actions to create your desired reality.

Here are some steps to follow to use the 888 Hz frequency for meditation and manifestation:

1. Find a comfortable place where you can relax and be undisturbed for at least 15 minutes. You can sit or lie down, as long as you keep your spine straight.
2. Put on some headphones or earphones and play some music or sounds that contain the 888 Hz frequency. You can find many options on YouTube or other platforms. Alternatively, you can use a tuning fork or a singing bowl that produces the 888 Hz tone.
3. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths. Relax your muscles and release any tension or stress from your body.
4. Set an intention for your meditation or manifestation session. What do you want to achieve or receive from this experience? You can say it out loud or silently in your mind.
5. Focus on the sound of the 888 Hz frequency and let it fill your ears and mind. Imagine that it is surrounding you with a bright white light that represents the angelic energy.
6. As you listen to the sound, pay attention to any sensations, images, words or messages that come to you. These are signs from your angels that they are listening and responding to your intention.
7. If you are meditating, simply observe these signs without judgment or attachment. If you are manifesting, affirm these signs as evidence that your desire is already yours. Feel grateful for receiving it and act as if it has already happened.
8. When you feel ready, gently open your eyes and return to your normal state of awareness. Thank your angels for their guidance and support. Write down any insights or impressions that you received during your session.
9. Repeat this process as often as you like, until you achieve your desired outcome or feel a strong connection with your angels.
