If so, you might want to try listening to the 396 Hz solfeggio frequency, a sound that can help you release guilt and fear and activate your root chakra.

## What are solfeggio frequencies?

Solfeggio frequencies are a set of six tones that were used in ancient Gregorian chants. They are believed to have healing and spiritual properties, as they are based on the mathematical patterns of the universe. Each frequency corresponds to a different aspect of human consciousness and can help you balance your energy and harmonize your body, mind and soul.

## What is the 396 Hz solfeggio frequency?

The 396 Hz solfeggio frequency is the first of the six tones. It is also known as Ut, which means "to do" or "to create" in Latin. This frequency helps you to overcome guilt and fear, which are two of the main obstacles to realization. Guilt and fear can keep you stuck in the past, prevent you from taking action, and lower your self-esteem and confidence. By listening to the 396 Hz solfeggio frequency, you can free yourself from these negative emotions and create a positive mindset that allows you to pursue your goals with courage and determination.

## How does the 396 Hz solfeggio frequency work?

The 396 Hz solfeggio frequency works by resonating with your root chakra, which is located at the base of your spine. The root chakra is responsible for your survival instincts, security, stability, and physical needs. When your root chakra is balanced, you feel grounded, safe, supported, and confident. When your root chakra is blocked, you feel anxious, fearful, insecure, and guilty. The 396 Hz solfeggio frequency helps to clear any blockages in your root chakra and restore its natural flow of energy. This way, you can release guilt and fear and feel more connected to yourself and the world around you.

- Use it as an affirmation by repeating "I release guilt and fear" or "I am safe and secure" while visualizing a red light filling your root chakra.
- Combine it with other healing modalities such as meditation, yoga, reiki, crystals, aromatherapy, etc.
