Adenoids are small glands that are located at the back of the nose. They are part of the immune system and help fight infections. However, sometimes they can become enlarged or infected, causing symptoms such as nasal congestion, snoring, ear infections, or difficulty breathing.

Some people claim that Rife 3D frequencies can help shrink or eliminate adenoids by using sound waves to destroy harmful microorganisms. Rife 3D frequencies are based on the idea that every living thing has a specific frequency, and that applying a matching frequency can cause resonance and destroy it.

In this blog post, I will share with you a Rife 3D frequencies healing preset for adenoids that I found online. The preset consists of 26 frequencies that are supposed to target the adenoids and the bacteria or viruses that cause inflammation. The frequencies are:

1550 hz, 802 hz, 880 hz, 787 hz, 776 hz, 727 hz, 444 hz, 20 hz, 428 hz, 660 hz, 2720 hz, 2170 hz, 14 hz, 333 hz, 523 hz, 768 hz, 786 hz, 428 hz, 1865 hz, 590 hz, 690 hz, 780 hz, 807 hz, 810 hz, 1570 hz, 2000 hz.

To use this preset, you will need a device that can generate and play these frequencies. You can use a computer software, a smartphone app, or a dedicated Rife machine. You will also need a pair of headphones or speakers to listen to the frequencies.

The recommended duration for this preset is 30 minutes per day for at least two weeks. You should listen to the frequencies at a comfortable volume level and relax while doing so. You can also combine this preset with other treatments or remedies that your doctor prescribes.

I hope this blog post was helpful and informative. Please remember that Rife 3D frequencies are not a substitute for professional medical care and that you should always consult your doctor before trying any new therapy. Thank you for reading and stay healthy!
