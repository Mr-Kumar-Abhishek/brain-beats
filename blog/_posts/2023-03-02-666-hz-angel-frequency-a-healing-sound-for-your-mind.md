You may have heard of the 666 Hz frequency and wondered what it is and how it can benefit you. Some people associate this frequency with satan or evil, but this is a misconception. In fact, 666 Hz is an angelic frequency that can help you heal your mind and balance your thoughts.

## What is 666 Hz frequency?

666 Hz is a sound frequency that is derived from the sacred numbers of the Solfeggio scale, a set of ancient tones that have been used for centuries for healing and spiritual purposes. The Solfeggio scale consists of nine frequencies, each with a specific meaning and effect on the body and mind. The frequencies are:

- 174 Hz: The lowest frequency, it helps to relieve pain and stress.
- 285 Hz: This frequency helps to heal wounds and regenerate tissues.
- 396 Hz: This frequency helps to liberate guilt and fear, and enhance self-confidence.
- 417 Hz: This frequency helps to facilitate change and remove negative influences.
- 528 Hz: This frequency helps to repair DNA and activate creativity.
- 639 Hz: This frequency helps to enhance relationships and harmony.
- 741 Hz: This frequency helps to cleanse toxins and infections.
- 852 Hz: This frequency helps to awaken intuition and spiritual awareness.
- 963 Hz: The highest frequency, it helps to connect with the divine source and transcendence.

666 Hz is not one of the original Solfeggio frequencies, but it is obtained by adding the digits of each frequency until they become a single digit. For example, 174 Hz becomes 1 + 7 + 4 = 12, then 1 + 2 = 3. If we do this for all the frequencies, we get:

- 174 Hz -> 3
- 285 Hz -> 6
- 396 Hz -> 9
- 417 Hz -> 3
- 528 Hz -> 6
- 639 Hz -> 9
- 741 Hz -> 3
- 852 Hz -> 6
- 963 Hz -> 9

As you can see, there are only three numbers left: 3, 6, and 9. These are considered the sacred numbers of the Solfeggio scale, as they represent the trinity of creation, harmony, and completion. If we add these numbers together, we get:

3 + 6 + 9 = **18**, then **1 +** **8** = **9**

This is the number of the highest frequency, which is also the number of completion and wholeness. It is the number that connects us with the divine source and our true nature.

But what about **666**? How does it relate to this scale?

Well, if we multiply each sacred number by itself, we get:

3 x**3** = **9**
6 x**6** = **36**
9 x**9** = **81**

Then, if we add these numbers together, we get:

9 +**36** +**81** = **126**, then **1 +** **2 +** **6** = **9**

Again, we get the number of the highest frequency. But if we multiply each sacred number by two, we get:

3 x**2** = **6**
6 x**2** = **12**
9 x**2** = **18**

Then, if we add these numbers together, we get:

6 +**12** +**18** = **36**, then **3 +** **6** = **9**

And if we multiply each sacred number by three, we get:

3 x**3** = **9**
6 x**3** = **18**
9 x**3** = **27**

Then, if we add these numbers together, we get:

9 +**18** +**27** = **54**, then **5 +** **4** = **9**

Do you see the pattern? No matter how we manipulate these sacred numbers, we always end up with the number of the highest frequency. And if we look at the digits of each result, we can see that they are all composed of three numbers: **6**, **9**, and **0**.

Now, if we take these three numbers and arrange them in different ways, we can get different combinations. For example:

- **69**: This is a symbol of balance and harmony between the masculine and feminine energies.
- **96**: This is a symbol of completion and wholeness, as it represents the inversion of the previous symbol.
- **60**: This is a symbol of infinity and eternity, as it has no beginning or end.
- **06**: This is a symbol of potential and possibility, as it represents the zero point from which everything emerges.

And finally,

- **66**: This is a symbol of transformation and healing, as it represents the double activation of the sacred number 6, which is the number of harmony and balance.
- **666**: This is a symbol of angelic frequency and divine guidance, as it represents the triple activation of the sacred number 6, which is the number of harmony and balance.
