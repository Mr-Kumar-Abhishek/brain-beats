If you are looking for a natural way to enhance your well-being, you might want to try listening to a 210.42 Hz pure tone. This is the frequency of the synodic moon, which is the time it takes for the moon to complete one orbit around the Earth. The musical note that corresponds to this frequency is G#, and the aura color is orange.

The 210.42 Hz pure tone is associated with the Svadisthan chakra, which is located just below the navel. This chakra governs your creativity, sexuality, emotions, and pleasure. It is also responsible for regulating your menstrual cycle and your glandular and lymphatic systems.

When your Svadisthan chakra is balanced, you feel confident, passionate, joyful, and sensual. You have a healthy relationship with yourself and others, and you express your creativity freely. You also have a regular and painless menstrual cycle, and your hormones are in harmony.

However, when your Svadisthan chakra is blocked or imbalanced, you may experience low self-esteem, guilt, shame, fear, anger, or depression. You may also have difficulty with intimacy, creativity, or emotional expression. You may suffer from irregular or painful periods, infertility, urinary infections, kidney problems, or pelvic disorders.

One way to heal and balance your Svadisthan chakra is to listen to a 210.42 Hz pure tone for at least 15 minutes a day. This frequency can help to stimulate your sexual energy, clear any emotional blockages, and restore your hormonal balance. It can also help to ease any menstrual or reproductive issues.

To use the 210.42 Hz pure tone effectively, you need to find a comfortable and quiet place where you can relax and focus on your breathing. You can use headphones or speakers to play the tone, but make sure the volume is not too loud or too soft. You can also light an orange candle or use an orange essential oil to enhance the effect of the frequency.

As you listen to the tone, close your eyes and visualize an orange light filling your lower abdomen. Feel the warmth and vibration of the light as it activates and energizes your Svadisthan chakra. Imagine that the light is dissolving any negative emotions or thoughts that are blocking your chakra. Breathe deeply and allow yourself to feel any sensations that arise in your body.

You can also repeat some positive affirmations that resonate with your Svadisthan chakra, such as:

- I am creative and expressive.
- I am passionate and sensual.
- I am joyful and playful.
- I love and accept myself.
- I honor my body and its cycles.

You can listen to the 210.42 Hz pure tone as often as you like, but it is recommended to do it at least once a week for optimal results. You may notice some changes in your mood, energy, creativity, or sexuality after a few sessions. You may also experience some physical detoxification or healing in your reproductive organs.

The 210.42 Hz pure tone is a powerful tool that can help you to heal and balance your Svadisthan chakra. By tuning into this frequency regularly, you can enhance your well-being and enjoy a more fulfilling life.
