Have you ever wondered what is the significance of 172.06 Hz pure tone? This frequency is not just a random number, but a powerful sound that resonates with the Platonic year, also known as the Great Year or the Precession of the Equinoxes. This is the period of time that it takes for the Earth's axis to complete one full cycle of wobble, which is about 26,000 years. 

According to ancient wisdom, this cycle corresponds to the evolution of human consciousness and the spiritual development of humanity. Each Platonic year is divided into 12 ages, each lasting about 2,160 years, and each associated with a zodiac sign. We are currently in the Age of Aquarius, which began around the year 2000 and will last until about 4,160 CE.

The frequency of 172.06 Hz is also related to the musical note of F, which is the fourth note in the C major scale. This note is said to have a harmonizing effect on the body and mind, and to stimulate creativity and intuition. The aura color of this frequency is purple-violet, which represents spirituality, wisdom, and transcendence.

The 172.06 Hz pure tone is also linked with the Sahasrar or Crown chakra, which is located at the top of the head. This chakra is the gateway to higher consciousness and cosmic unity, and it is where we experience enlightenment, bliss, and peace. When this chakra is balanced, we feel joyful, cheerful, spiritual, and connected to our true self and the divine.

One of the benefits of listening to this frequency is that it can act as an antidepressant, as it helps to release serotonin and endorphins in the brain. These are natural chemicals that make us feel happy, relaxed, and optimistic. Listening to this frequency can also help to reduce stress, anxiety, insomnia, and headaches.

The 172.06 Hz pure tone has a lot of significance in Chinese culture as well. It is considered to be one of the six healing sounds that correspond to the six organs: liver, heart, spleen, lungs, kidneys, and triple burner. The sound for the liver is "shu", which sounds like "shoo". This sound helps to detoxify the liver and improve its function.

If you want to experience the benefits of this frequency, you can listen to it online or download it as an mp3 file. You can also use a tuning fork or a singing bowl that produces this sound. You can listen to it for as long as you like, but ideally for at least 15 minutes a day. You can also meditate with this sound or chant it as a mantra.

Here are some tips on how to use this frequency effectively:

- Find a quiet and comfortable place where you won't be disturbed.
- Wear headphones or earphones for better sound quality and immersion.
- Close your eyes and relax your body and mind.
- Breathe deeply and slowly.
- Focus on the sound and feel its vibration in your body.
- Visualize a purple-violet light filling your crown chakra and spreading throughout your body.
- Affirm positive statements such as "I am joyful", "I am spiritual", "I am connected", etc.
- Express gratitude for this experience and for your life.

By using this frequency regularly, you can enhance your well-being, happiness, and spirituality. You can also align yourself with the cosmic cycle and the energy of the Age of Aquarius. Try it out today and see how it makes you feel!
