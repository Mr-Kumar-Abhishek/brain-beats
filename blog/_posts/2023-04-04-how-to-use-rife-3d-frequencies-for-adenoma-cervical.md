Rife 3D frequencies are a type of sound therapy that uses specific frequencies to target different health conditions. They are based on the work of Dr. Royal Rife, who claimed to have discovered the resonant frequencies of various pathogens and diseases in the 1930s.

One of the conditions that Rife 3D frequencies can help with is adenoma cervical, which is a type of epithelial tumor of the cervix that can be either benign or malignant. Adenoma cervical is also known as cervical cancer, and it is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide.

According to Rife 3D frequencies theory, adenoma cervical has a resonant frequency of 433 hz, which means that exposing the tumor to this frequency can cause it to vibrate and break down. This can reduce the size and growth of the tumor, and potentially eliminate it completely.

To use Rife 3D frequencies for adenoma cervical, you will need a device that can generate and emit sound waves at 433 hz. You can use a smartphone app, a computer program, or a dedicated Rife machine. You will also need a pair of headphones or speakers to listen to the frequency.

The recommended protocol for using Rife 3D frequencies for adenoma cervical is as follows:

- Set your device to play the frequency of 433 hz continuously or in pulses.
- Place your headphones over your ears or your speakers near your cervix.
- Listen to the frequency for at least 15 minutes, twice a day, for six weeks.
- Monitor your symptoms and consult your doctor regularly.

Some people may experience side effects from using Rife 3D frequencies, such as headaches, nausea, fatigue, or dizziness. These are usually mild and temporary, and can be reduced by drinking plenty of water and resting between sessions. However, if you experience any severe or persistent side effects, stop using the frequency and seek medical attention.

Rife 3D frequencies are not a substitute for conventional medical treatment, and they should not be used without consulting your doctor. They are not approved by the FDA or any other regulatory agency, and their effectiveness and safety have not been proven by scientific studies. Use them at your own risk and discretion.
