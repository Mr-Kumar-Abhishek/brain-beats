The Manipura chakra, also known as the solar plexus chakra, is located slightly below the navel. It is associated with the element of fire, and it governs our personal power, self-esteem, confidence, and willpower. When the Manipura chakra is balanced, we feel energized, motivated, and in control of our lives. When it is blocked or imbalanced, we may experience low self-esteem, anxiety, fear, anger, or digestive issues.

One way to balance and activate the Manipura chakra is to use sound healing with a pure tone of 126.22 Hz. This frequency resonates with the vibration of the Manipura chakra, and it can help to clear any blockages and restore harmony in this energy center. In this blog post, I will explain how to use 126.22 Hz pure tone for Manipura chakra meditation, and what benefits you can expect from this practice.

## What is a Pure Tone?

A pure tone is a sound that has a single frequency and no harmonics or overtones. It is the simplest form of sound, and it can be produced by a tuning fork, a sine wave generator, or a digital audio software. A pure tone can have different frequencies, measured in hertz (Hz), which determine the pitch of the sound. For example, a pure tone of 440 Hz corresponds to the musical note A.

A pure tone can be used for sound healing because it can directly affect the vibration of our energy centers or chakras. Each chakra has a specific frequency range that matches its function and element. By exposing ourselves to a pure tone that matches the frequency of a chakra, we can stimulate and balance that chakra.
