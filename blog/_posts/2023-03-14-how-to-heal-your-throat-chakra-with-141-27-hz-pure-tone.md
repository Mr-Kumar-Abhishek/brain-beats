The throat chakra, or Vishudda in Sanskrit, is the fifth of the seven main energy centers in the body. It is located at the base of the throat and is responsible for communication, expression, creativity, and truth. When the throat chakra is balanced, you can speak your mind with confidence, listen with empathy, and express yourself authentically. When the throat chakra is blocked, you may experience difficulties in communicating your thoughts and feelings, fear of being judged or rejected, or physical symptoms such as sore throat, thyroid problems, or dental issues.
