Have you ever heard of the solfeggio frequencies? They are a set of musical tones that are said to have healing and spiritual properties. Each frequency corresponds to a different aspect of our being, such as physical, emotional, mental, or spiritual.

One of the solfeggio frequencies is 2184 Hz, which is associated with the chakra of holy fire. This is a very special and powerful chakra that is not often talked about. It is located above the chakra of fertile soil, which is few feets above the head. The chakra of holy fire looks like a living plant that is being burned by fire, but it also brings new life when it is balanced.

The chakra of holy fire connects us to the Atar and Agni, the holy fire that is present in all creation. It is the source of inspiration, creativity, passion, and transformation. It gives us many ideas, opportunities, support, and clear guidance from higher powers. It also helps us to experience vivid dreams, friendship, and love.

However, working with the chakra of holy fire can also be challenging. It is a very yang chakra that can easily become unbalanced if we neglect our lower, earth chakras. If we have too much fire energy, we can become restless, impulsive, aggressive, or burned out. If we have too little fire energy, we can become dull, depressed, fearful, or stagnant.

Therefore, it is important to balance the chakra of holy fire with the other solfeggio frequencies and chakras. One way to do this is to listen to 2184 Hz music or sound healing. This can help us to activate and harmonize the chakra of holy fire and its qualities. Another way is to meditate on the color and shape of the chakra of holy fire. Its color is bright red and green, which symbolize the balance between fire and life. Its shape is a flame-like plant that reminds us of the cycle of creation and destruction.

By working with the chakra of holy fire and 2184 Hz frequency, we can tap into our inner fire and ignite our true potential. We can become more creative, passionate, and inspired in our lives. We can also connect to the divine fire that burns within us and all things.
