Actinomyces israelii is a type of bacteria that normally lives in the mouth, throat, and intestines. It usually does not cause any problems, but sometimes it can invade other tissues and organs, causing serious infections. These infections are called actinomycosis, and they can affect the lungs, abdomen, pelvis, bones, joints, skin, and brain. Actinomycosis can cause abscesses, fistulas, inflammation, and tissue damage.

One of the alternative therapies that some people use for actinomycosis is Rife 3D frequencies. Rife 3D frequencies are based on the idea that every living organism has a specific frequency or vibration, and that applying the right frequency can destroy or weaken the organism. Rife 3D frequencies are generated by a device that emits electromagnetic waves through electrodes or plasma tubes.

In this blog post, I will show you how to use Rife 3D frequencies for actinomyces israelii. I will explain what frequencies to use, how long to use them, and what precautions to take. Please note that this is not a substitute for medical treatment, and that you should always consult your doctor before trying any alternative therapies.

## What Frequencies to Use

There are many different frequencies that are claimed to be effective for actinomyces israelii. However, there is no scientific evidence to support these claims, and the results may vary from person to person. Therefore, you should use caution and experiment with different frequencies to find what works best for you.

One of the sources that provides a list of frequencies for actinomyces israelii is the Brain Beats website. This website allows you to create your own presets of frequencies and run them on your device. According to the Rife 3D software, the frequencies for actinomyces israelii are: 23 hz, 222 hz, 262 hz, 2154 hz, 465 hz, 488 hz, 567 hz, 7880 hz, 10000 hz, 787 hz, 747 hz, 727 hz, 20 hz, 660 hz, 690 hz, 160 hz, 73 hz, 1.1 hz

These frequencies are based on the work of Dr. Royal Raymond Rife, who was a pioneer in the field of frequency therapy in the early 20th century. He claimed to have discovered the frequencies that could kill various pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. However, his work was controversial and never accepted by the mainstream medical community.

## How Long to Use Them

The duration of using Rife 3D frequencies depends on several factors, such as the severity of your infection, your overall health, your device settings, and your personal preference. There is no definitive answer to how long you should use them, but here are some general guidelines:

- Start with a low intensity and a short session. For example, you can start with a 10-minute session at a low power level.
- Gradually increase the intensity and the duration as you feel comfortable. For example, you can increase the session length by 5 minutes every week until you reach an hour.
- Listen to your body and adjust accordingly. If you feel any discomfort or adverse effects, such as headache, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, or skin irritation, stop the session immediately and reduce the intensity or duration next time.
- Do not overdo it. Using Rife 3D frequencies too much or too often can cause more harm than good. It can overload your system and cause stress or damage to your cells and organs.
- Take breaks between sessions. Give your body time to rest and recover from the frequency exposure. You can take a day or two off every week or every month.
- Monitor your symptoms and results. Keep track of how you feel before and after each session. Note any changes in your infection signs, such as pain, swelling, drainage, fever, or weight loss.
- Consult your doctor regularly. Do not rely solely on Rife 3D frequencies for treating your infection. Follow your doctor's advice and take any prescribed medications as directed.

## What Precautions to Take

Using Rife 3D frequencies is not without risks or side effects. You should be aware of the potential dangers and take precautions to avoid them. Here are some of the precautions you should take:

- Do not use Rife 3D frequencies if you have a pacemaker, defibrillator, or any other implanted electronic device. The sound waves can interfere with the device and cause malfunction or damage.
- Do not use Rife 3D frequencies if you are pregnant, nursing, or trying to conceive. The sound waves can affect the development of the fetus or the quality of the breast milk.
- Do not use Rife 3D frequencies if you have epilepsy, seizures, or any other neurological disorder. The sound waves can trigger or worsen the condition.

## Conclusion

Rife 3D frequencies are a form of alternative therapy that some people use for actinomyces israelii infections. They are based on the idea that applying specific frequencies can kill or weaken the bacteria. However, there is no scientific evidence to support this claim, and the results may vary from person to person. Therefore, you should use caution and discretion when using Rife 3D frequencies. You should also consult your doctor before and during the treatment, and follow their instructions. Rife 3D frequencies are not a cure or a substitute for medical care.
