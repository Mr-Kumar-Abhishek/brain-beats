You may have heard of white noise, pink noise, or brown noise, but have you ever heard of yellow noise? Yellow noise is a type of noise that has a boosted frequency band of noise centered around 200 hertz. It sounds like a steady low mid push, similar to being in a giant seashell or inside a passenger jet in flight. It is not one of the broadcast industry noise colors by definition, but can be created using the method of matching up the light spectrum. In this blog post, we will explore what yellow noise is, how it differs from other types of noise, and how it can benefit you.

## What is Yellow Noise?

Yellow noise is a type of noise that has a boosted frequency band of noise centered around 200 hertz. It sounds like a steady low mid push, similar to being in a giant seashell or inside a passenger jet in flight. It is not one of the broadcast industry noise colors by definition, but can be created using the method of matching up the light spectrum.

Noise is defined as any unwanted sound that interferes with communication, hearing, or enjoyment. However, not all noise is bad. Some types of noise can actually help you relax, sleep, study, or block out other noises. These types of noise are called **noise colors**.

Noise colors are named after the colors of light that have similar frequency spectra. For example, white noise has equal power across all frequencies, just like white light has equal brightness across all wavelengths. Pink noise has more power at lower frequencies than higher frequencies, just like pink light has more red than blue. Brown noise has even more power at lower frequencies than pink noise, just like brown light has more red than green.

Yellow noise is not one of the standard noise colors, but it can be created using the same principle. Yellow light has more green than red, and more red than blue. Similarly, yellow noise has more power at mid frequencies than low or high frequencies. Specifically, yellow noise has a boosted frequency band of noise centered around 200 hertz.

## How Does Yellow Noise Differ from Other Types of Noise?

Yellow noise differs from other types of noise in its frequency spectrum and its sound quality. Here are some comparisons between yellow noise and other common types of noise:

- White noise: White noise has equal power across all frequencies, while yellow noise has more power at mid frequencies than low or high frequencies. White noise sounds like static or hissing, while yellow noise sounds like a steady low mid push.
- Pink noise: Pink noise has more power at lower frequencies than higher frequencies, while yellow noise has more power at mid frequencies than low or high frequencies. Pink noise sounds like a waterfall or a fan, while yellow noise sounds like a giant seashell or a passenger jet in flight.
- Brown noise: Brown noise has even more power at lower frequencies than pink noise, while yellow noise has more power at mid frequencies than low or high frequencies. Brown noise sounds like a rumble or a thunderstorm, while yellow noise sounds like a giant seashell or a passenger jet in flight.
- Blue noise: Blue noise has more power at higher frequencies than lower frequencies, while yellow noise has more power at mid frequencies than low or high frequencies. Blue noise sounds like a whistle or a siren, while yellow noise sounds like a giant seashell or a passenger jet in flight.

## How Can Yellow Noise Benefit You?

Yellow noise can benefit you in several ways, depending on your needs and preferences. Here are some possible benefits of yellow
noise:

- Relaxation: Yellow noise can help you relax by creating a soothing and consistent sound environment that blocks out distracting noises. Yellow noise can also mimic the sound of nature or travel, which can induce feelings of calmness and comfort.
- Sleep: Yellow noise can help you sleep by masking noises that might otherwise keep you awake or wake you up during the night. Yellow noise can also create a sense of security and coziness that can promote deeper and longer sleep.
- Study: Yellow noise can help you study by enhancing your concentration and focus by reducing auditory distractions and creating a stable sound background. Yellow noise can also stimulate your brain activity and creativity by providing a subtle auditory stimulation.
- Noise blocking: Yellow noise can help you block out unwanted noises that might interfere with your activities or well-being. Yellow noise can cover up noises such as traffic, construction, neighbors, snoring, etc.

## How to Use Yellow Noise?

You can use yellow
noise in various ways depending on your situation and preference. Here are some possible ways to use yellow
noise:

- Online: You can find many online sources that offer free or paid yellow noise generators or recordings that you can play on your computer, smartphone,tablet, etc. You can adjust the volume and duration according to your needs.
- Offline: You can download or purchase yellow
noise files or CDs that you can play on your audio devices such as speakers, headphones, earbuds, etc. You can also use a noise machine that produces yellow noise or other types of noise colors.
- DIY: You can create your own yellow
noise by using an equalizer or a filter that boosts the frequency band around 200 hertz. You can apply this to any type of noise source such as white noise, pink noise, brown noise, etc.

## Conclusion

Yellow noise is a type of noise that has a boosted frequency band of noise centered around 200 hertz. It sounds like a steady low mid push, similar to being in a giant seashell or inside a passenger jet in flight. It is not one of the broadcast industry noise colors by definition, but can be created using the method of matching up the light spectrum. Yellow noise can benefit you in various ways such as relaxation, sleep, study, or noise blocking. You can use yellow noise online, offline, or DIY depending on your situation and preference.
