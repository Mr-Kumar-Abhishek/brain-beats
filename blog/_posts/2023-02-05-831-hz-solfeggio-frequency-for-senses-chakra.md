Have you ever heard of the solfeggio frequencies? They are a set of tones that were used in ancient Gregorian chants and are believed to have healing and spiritual benefits. One of these frequencies is 831 Hz, which corresponds to the senses chakra.

The senses chakra, is located between the mouth chakra and the third eye, or ajna chakra. It is associated with the color indigo and the element of light. It governs our intuition, imagination, vision, and psychic abilities.

The senses chakra allows us to see beyond the physical realm and access higher levels of consciousness. It is also the center of our inner perception and guidance. When this chakra is balanced, we have sensitivy, expression, intuition and service of others for a higher purpose.

However, when this chakra is imbalanced, we may experience hypersensitive, nervous, stubborn, sarcastic. We will also have caustic expression, be confused by internal feeling or intuition. We may feel disconnected from our inner self and our higher power. 

One way to balance and activate this chakra is to listen to the solfeggio frequency of 831 Hz. This frequency helps us to awaken our senses and enhance our perception. It also helps us to connect with our inner voice and our divine guidance. It can also stimulate our creativity and imagination.

To listen to this frequency, you can use a tuning fork, a singing bowl, a sound generator, or a music track that incorporates this tone. You can also chant the syllable "OM" or "AUM", which resonates with this chakra. You can do this as a meditation practice or as a background sound while you work or relax.

Another way to balance and activate this chakra is to use visualization techniques. You can imagine a bright indigo light shining from all your senses and filling your entire body with its energy. You can also use affirmations such as:

- I trust my intuition and follow my guidance.
- I see clearly and perceive the truth.
- I manifest my visions with ease and grace.
- I am connected to my higher self and my divine source.

The senses chakra is a powerful portal to our inner world and our sensory realm. By tuning into the solfeggio frequency of 831 Hz, we can enhance our senses and awaken our senses chakra. This will help us to access our innate gifts of sensitivity and strength, expressiveness and intuition, and use them for a higher purpose.
