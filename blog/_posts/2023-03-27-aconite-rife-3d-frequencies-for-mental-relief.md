Aconite is a plant that has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes, such as stimulating lymphocyte production, reducing inflammation, and relieving pain. However, aconite can also be toxic and cause serious side effects if taken in large doses or for a long time. Therefore, it is not recommended to use aconite without proper guidance from a qualified practitioner.

One alternative way to benefit from the healing properties of aconite without ingesting it is to use Rife 3D frequencies. Rife 3D frequencies are sound waves that are designed to resonate with specific organs, tissues, or pathogens in the body. By applying these frequencies to the affected area, you can stimulate the natural healing process and restore balance.

In this blog post, I will share with you a Rife 3D frequencies preset that I have created for mental relief from aconite. This preset is based on the research of Dr. Royal Raymond Rife, who discovered that certain frequencies can destroy harmful microorganisms and enhance the immune system. The frequencies in this preset are:

- 3347 hz: This frequency is associated with the thymus gland, which is responsible for producing T-cells that fight infections and cancer. This frequency can help boost your immunity and protect you from diseases.
- 5611 hz: This frequency is associated with the hypothalamus, which is the master gland that regulates many functions in the body, such as mood, appetite, sleep, and stress. This frequency can help balance your hormones and emotions and reduce anxiety and depression.
- 2791 hz: This frequency is associated with the pineal gland, which is the seat of intuition and spirituality. This frequency can help activate your third eye and enhance your psychic abilities and awareness.

To use this preset, you will need [brain beats](https://brain-beats.in) that can generate these frequencies and apply them to your body. You can either use headphones or speakers to listen to the frequencies. You should use this preset for at least 15 minutes a day, preferably before bedtime, to achieve optimal results.
