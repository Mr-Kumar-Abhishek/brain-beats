Have you ever wondered why some sounds can make you feel relaxed, while others can make you feel agitated? The answer lies in the frequency of the sound waves, which can affect your brainwaves and your mood. One of the most beneficial frequencies for healing and regeneration is 285 hz, which belongs to the ancient Solfeggio scale.

## What is the Solfeggio scale?

The Solfeggio scale is a set of six musical tones that were used in Gregorian chants and other sacred music. Each tone has a specific frequency and a corresponding meaning, such as:

- 396 hz - Liberation from fear and guilt

- 528 hz - Activation of love and miracles
- 639 hz - Enhancement of communication and relationships
- 741 hz - Awakening of intuition and creativity
- 852 hz - Connection to the divine and spiritual order

The Solfeggio scale was rediscovered in the 20th century by Dr. Joseph Puleo, who found references to these frequencies in the Bible and other ancient texts. He also noticed that these frequencies have a mathematical relationship with each other, forming a perfect circle when plotted on a graph.
