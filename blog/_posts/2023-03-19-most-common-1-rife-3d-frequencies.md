If you are looking for a simple and effective way to use Rife frequencies, you might want to try the most common 1 Rife 3D frequencies preset. This preset is designed to cover a wide range of health issues and boost your immune system. In this blog post, I will explain what Rife frequencies are, how they work, and how to use this preset.

## What are Rife frequencies?

Rife frequencies are named after Dr. Royal Raymond Rife, who discovered in the 1930s that certain frequencies of electromagnetic waves can destroy harmful microorganisms in the body. He developed a device called the Rife machine, which could generate and transmit these frequencies to the target area. He claimed that he could cure many diseases, including cancer, by using his machine.

However, his work was met with skepticism and opposition from the medical establishment, and he was eventually forced to stop his research. His original machine and records were destroyed, and his findings were largely forgotten.

## How do Rife frequencies work?

Rife frequencies work on the principle of resonance. Resonance is when one object vibrates at the same frequency as another object, causing the second object to amplify its vibration. For example, when you strike a tuning fork, it will make a sound that matches its natural frequency. If you bring another tuning fork of the same frequency close to it, it will also start to vibrate and make the same sound.

Rife frequencies use resonance to destroy harmful microorganisms in the body. Each microorganism has its own natural frequency, which can be found by using a microscope and a frequency generator. When you expose the microorganism to its matching frequency, it will start to vibrate and break apart. This is similar to how an opera singer can shatter a glass by hitting the right note.

By using a Rife machine or a similar device, you can generate and apply Rife frequencies to your body. The frequencies will pass through your healthy cells without harming them, but they will resonate with and destroy the harmful microorganisms that cause disease.
