Have you ever wondered what is the secret behind the ancient practice of tantra? How can you tap into the powerful energy of your sacral chakra and unleash your creativity, passion and joy? In this blog post, I will share with you the benefits of listening to a pure tone of 157.43 Hz, which is one of the sacred frequencies that can activate and balance your sacral chakra.

## What is the sacral chakra?

The sacral chakra, or Svadhisthana in Sanskrit, is the second of the seven main energy centers in your body. It is located just below your navel, in the area of your lower abdomen and reproductive organs. It is associated with the element of water, the color orange, and the sense of taste.

The sacral chakra governs your emotions, sexuality, creativity, pleasure and relationships. When it is open and balanced, you feel confident, expressive, sensual, playful and joyful. You have a healthy relationship with yourself and others, and you can create and enjoy life to the fullest.

However, when your sacral chakra is blocked or imbalanced, you may experience emotional instability, guilt, shame, fear, addiction, repression, frustration or depression. You may also have physical issues such as lower back pain, urinary tract infections, infertility or sexual dysfunction.

## How can 157.43 Hz help your sacral chakra?

One of the ways to heal and balance your sacral chakra is to use sound therapy. Sound is a form of vibration that can affect your energy field and your physical body. Different frequencies have different effects on your chakras and your overall well-being.

157.43 Hz is a pure tone that resonates with the frequency of your sacral chakra. It is also known as the "tantric frequency" because it can stimulate and awaken your kundalini energy, which is the primal life force that lies dormant at the base of your spine. When this energy rises through your chakras, it can lead to spiritual awakening and enlightenment.

Listening to 157.43 Hz can help you:

- Release emotional blockages and heal past traumas
